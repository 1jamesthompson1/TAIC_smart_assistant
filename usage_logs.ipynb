Collisions and Track Worker Injuries:\\n   - 2023, HRV/Track Worker Collision: A collision involving a Hi-Rail Vehicle (HRV) and track workers highlighted insufficient staff training for independent HRV movement, lack of enhanced training and supervision, and workload delegation issues. Report: RO-2023-101 ([see safety issues](https://www.taic.org.nz/inquiry/RO-2023-101)).\\n   - 2021, Ferry Wagon Coupling Accident: Overloading of wagons exceeded safe limits on the Aratere rail ferry, leading to difficulties in coupling operations and injury to a rail operations worker. Report: RO-2021-101 ([see safety issues](https://www.taic.org.nz/inquiry/RO-2021-101)).\\n\\n2. Level Crossing Safety & Failures:\\n   - Several investigations found issues such as lack of risk assessment when protections at level crossings are disconnected, ineffective consultation between road and rail authorities, and visibility below minimum requirements at crossings. (RO-2021-102, RO-2022-104, RO-2022-103, RO-2020-103).\\n   - Notably, propelling (pushing) rail movements occurred regularly at some crossings without risk assessment, raising collision risks (RO-2022-104).\\n\\n3. Derailments:\\n   - 2023, Weather-related Derailment: KiwiRail\\u2019s adverse-weather response was found inadequate, with insufficient and inconsistent application around NZ, and weaknesses in crew training for reporting/receiving unusual weather data. Maintenance of third-party waterways (e.g., culverts) was also found lacking. Report: RO-2023-102 ([see safety issues](https://www.taic.org.nz/inquiry/RO-2023-102)).\\n   - 2021, Slope Instability and Lack of Response Plan: On the K\\u0101piti rail corridor, a medium slope stability risk was known but not sufficiently mitigated, contributing to a derailment. There was also no triggered action response plan (TARP) between operator Transdev Wellington and KiwiRail, creating evacuation risks. Report: RO-2021-104 ([see safety issues](https://www.taic.org.nz/inquiry/RO-2021-104)).\\n\\n4. Safeworking Rule/Procedure Breaches:\\n   - Repeated recent incidents involved short staffing, non-compliance with administrative safety controls, ineffective non-technical skills, and miscommunication between personnel responsible for track safety. (RO-2023-103, RO-2020-104).\\n\\n5. Signals Passed at Danger (SPAD) and Other Systemic Safety Issues:\\n   - Auckland\\u2019s and Wellington\\u2019s networks experienced different levels of risk protection due to variable engineering controls on rolling stock, weaknesses in route knowledge training for locomotive engineers, and gaps in automatic emergency radio reporting when a brake is applied (RO-2023-104, RO-2024-101, RO-2021-104).\\n\\n6. Rolling Stock and Runaway Events:\\n   - 2021, Passenger Train Parting: An out-of-specification coupler allowed a train to part while in motion; controls to manage inter-car jumper cable disruption were not present. (RO-2021-103).\\n   - 2021, Runaway Rail Movements: Lack of physical protection and inconsistent communication/procedures around the Picton ferry rail linkspan increased the risk of unintended or runaway rail vehicle movements (RO-2021-105).\\n\\nFor more detailed analysis or specific reports, please let me know if you wish to view full investigations on any of the cases listed above.\", \"options\": null}]",

However, it does not address the performance in low adhesion conditions of modern metropolitan passenger trains that are fitted with computer controlled brake and wheel slide protection systems. The current National Rail System Standard (6) does not require any more from a braking system than for a train to be able to stop within a specified distance in dry conditions.\\\\n\\\\nThe regulator for the country of operation or the purchaser may define what adhesion conditions might be encountered on a rail network and what level of braking performance is expected from a new train and what standards the train is to be tested to for compliance. This is also the stage in commissioning a new train, when the interaction between all of the brake systems is adjusted to achieve the optimum overall brake performance.  The Rail Safety and Standards Board in UK have produced a Guidance Note (GM/GN2695) to achieve this purpose in the UK but nothing similar exists for New Zealand.\\\\n\\\\nThe Matangi train brake systems were tested for compliance and proper operation, but they were not tested and adjusted for optimum brake performance in low adhesion conditions.\\\\n\\\\nIn Wellington, where new trains were commissioned into service with computer controlled braking and wheel slide protection systems, but that the complete train braking systems were not optimised to achieve the most effective brake performance in low adhesion conditions.  The Commission considers that the occurrences in Wellington may be repeated unless the National Rail System standards are revised. \\\\n\\\\nAs a minimum the Commission considers that the National Rail System standards should call upon appropriate international standards to formalise new train type testing and ensure that train braking systems are tested in low adhesion conditions and optimised for the train.\\\\n\\\\nThe Commission recommends that the Chief Executive of the New Zealand Transport Agency require a full review of the National Rail System standards, and in particular standard No. 6, to ensure that low adhesion braking requirements are defined in the standards and made applicable for all trains intended to operate on the National Rail System.</td>\\n      <td>TAIC_r_2014_103</td>\\n      <td>2014</td>\\n      <td>1</td>\\n      <td>TAIC</td>\\n      <td>Collision</td>\\n      <td>RO-2014-103</td>\\n      <td>https://www.taic.org.nz/inquiry/RO-2014-103</td>\\n      <td>recommendation</td>\\n      <td>0.789507</td>\\n    </tr>\\n    <tr>\\n      <td>TAIC_007/21</td>\\n      <td>On 27 October 2021 the Commission recommended that the Secretary for Local Government provide leadership to, and work with local authorities to ensure that traffic management plans identify any rail crossings within the vicinity of the proposed work and that the rail access providers have been consulted to ensure that any additional safety requirements in relation to the road/rail interface are met.</td>\\n      <td>TAIC_r_2019_108</td>\\n      <td>2019</td>\\n      <td>1</td>\\n      <td>TAIC</td>\\n      <td>Level Crossing</td>\\n      <td>RO-2019-108</td>\\n      <td>https://www.taic.org.nz/inquiry/RO-2019-108</td>\\n      <td>recommendation</td>\\n      <td>0.789860</td>\\n    </tr>\\n    <tr>\\n      <td>TAIC_033/17</td>\\n      <td>There is a heightened risk of trains colliding within the approaches to Wellington Station because limited available space makes the track layout congested.

They typically describe a \\\\nsystem problem that has the potential to adversely affect future operations on a wide \\\\nscale.  \\\\n Safety issues may be addressed by safety actions taken by a participant, otherwise the \\\\nCommission may issue a recommendation to address the issue.  \\\\n Two new safety issues were identified in this investigation. \\\\nThere was no evidence that the rail industry had been consulted on legislation changes \\\\naffecting the safety of the rail corridor.  \\\\n The amendments made to the Rule in 2009, which provided exemptions for passenger \\\\nservice vehicles stopping at level crossings, appear to have been developed without \\\\ninput from the rail sector. KiwiRail has no record of being consulted or making \\\\nsubmissions on the proposed change. Waka Kotahi NZ Transport Agency was unable \\\\nto provide evidence of any submissions having been made by the rail industry. \\\\nThe amendments to the Land Transport (Road User) Rule did not consider the risks to road and \\\\nrail users at level crossings in close proximity to road intersections. \\\\n The removal of a requirement for passenger service vehicles to stop before level \\\\ncrossings fitted with active protection was intended to lower the risk to road users. Not \\\\nconsidering the added dangers posed by level crossings in close proximity to road \\\\nintersections could have increased the risk to road and rail users at these crossings. \\\\n No action has been taken by Waka Kotahi NZ Transport Agency to address these \\\\nsafety issues. Therefore the Commission has made a recommendation in Section 6 to \\\\naddress these issues.</td>\\n      <td>TAIC_r_2020_103</td>\\n      <td>2020</td>\\n      <td>1</td>\\n      <td>TAIC</td>\\n      <td>Level Crossing</td>\\n      <td>RO-2020-103</td>\\n      <td>https://www.taic.org.nz/inquiry/RO-2020-103</td>\\n      <td>report_section</td>\\n      <td>10.542433</td>\\n    </tr>\\n    <tr>\\n      <td>TAIC_4.2.15</td>\\n      <td>4.2.15. The Commission engaged a clinical psychologist16 to assist at interviews of key participants \\\\nand to analyse the controller's actions from a psychological perspective.

The effect is \\\\ncommonly observed in athletes and students and characterised by levels of \\\\nperformance which are below those that would normally be expected.

It presents special challenges and risks for shipping compared to other harbours due to its shifting sand bars, banks, and shoals extending seaward for miles. \\n\\nSome of the key points about the Manukau Bar include:\\n\\n1. **Navigational Hazard**: The Bar is a shifting sand bar formed by sediment deposits, creating shallow areas that make navigating ships challenging. It requires experienced navigation due to unpredictable wave conditions which can heighten rapidly. [TAIC_m_2001_206, TAIC_m_2005_211](https://www.taic.org.nz/inquiry/MO-2001-206), [TAIC_m_2021_204](https://www.taic.org.nz/inquiry/MO-2021-204).\\n\\n2. **Signals and Procedures**: The Manukau Bar has specific procedures for crossing, often requiring communication with signal stations for weather and wave observations to ensure safe crossing. The master of the ship is often required to confirm conditions before attempting a crossing. [TAIC_m_2010_206](https://www.taic.org.nz/inquiry/MO-2010-206).\\n\\n3. **Challenges and Recommendations**: There are institutional guidelines and recommendations on procedures for safely crossing the Bar, including the importance of maintaining a safe distance offshore until safe conditions are confirmed and the requirement for emergency plans should conditions deteriorate [TAIC_m_2001_207](https://www.taic.org.nz/inquiry/MO-2001-207), [TAIC_m_2016_206](https://www.taic.org.nz/inquiry/MO-2016-206).\\n\\n4. **Past Incidents**: The Manukau Bar has been a location for several maritime incidents due to its challenging conditions.

If it's a custom interface, the presence and location of a clear button would depend on how the developer designed the interface.\\n\\nIf you're developing or modifying a Gradio application and want to add a clear button, you might want to refer to Gradio's documentation to implement it properly.

The road-\\\\ntrain driver was slightly injured while the two train drivers were shaken but otherwise unhurt. \\\\nTrain 4A13N was conveying four empty fuel tankers for loading at the Mobil fuel depot that is \\\\nabout 1 km beyond the Stirling Street level crossing. The road-train had just departed from the \\\\nAdelaide Brighton Cement Works at Birkenhead with a consignment of cement that was bound for \\\\nRoxby Downs in central SA.  \\\\nThe Stirling Street level crossing is located on the dual gauge Dry Creek to Outer Harbor 'freight \\\\nonly' rail corridor. Stirling Street is a short, sealed, two-way dead end street that provides access to \\\\nbulk fuel and cement facilities in the immediate vicinity.  \\\\nFor about 34 months before the collision, the Port River Expressway Project had been underway on \\\\nthe Dry Creek to Outer Harbor rail corridor. The project included the re-laying of the rail line and \\\\nthe upgrade of the Stirling Street level crossing from passive control ('Stop' sign) to active control \\\\n(flashing lights and boom barriers). These works were only partially completed at the time of the \\\\ncollision.  \\\\nOn the day of the collision, the Stirling Street level crossing was within a worksite that was \\\\nassociated with the Port River Expressway Project. In accordance with the protection measures for \\\\nthe worksite, train 4A13N had been stopped by a flagman about 130 m from the level crossing. \\\\nWhen all personnel and equipment were clear of the track, train 4A13N was given permission to \\\\nproceed into the worksite and over the Stirling Street level crossing. Several witnesses confirmed \\\\nthat, at this time, the locomotive horn was sounded several times and that the locomotive headlight \\\\nwas illuminated.  \\\\nShortly after, the train driver made an emergency application of the train brake when he realised \\\\nthat there was a collision risk at the level crossing with an approaching road-train. Train 4A13N \\\\ncollided with the lead trailer of the road-train almost at the centre of the pneumatic cement tank. \\\\nThe impact speed of both the train and road-train was low (about 15 km/h) but nevertheless \\\\nsufficient to roll the prime mover and the leading trailer onto their sides and to derail the lead bogie \\\\nof the train's locomotive. \\\\nWhile evidence in regard to the sequence of events in the moments before the collision varies \\\\nconsiderably, the investigation concluded that it is likely the road-train did not stop at the Stop sign \\\\nassembly and travelled over the Stirling Street level crossing at a relatively constant speed of about \\\\n15 km/h into the path of train 4A13N. It is very unlikely that the road-train driver stopped at the \\\\nStop sign assembly, but if he did, he displayed poor judgement in electing to accelerate normally \\\\nfrom a position that was effectively blind to oncoming rail traffic. \\\\nThe investigation found that the double trailer road-train did not have a Heavy Vehicle Permit \\\\n(HVP) to operate on Stirling Street at the time of the collision. As such, the owner and driver of the \\\\ndouble trailer road-train did not hold any authority to operate this vehicle over the Stirling Street \\\\nlevel crossing. In addition, the ARTC had not recently been approached to issue clearances for other \\\\nlevel crossings in SA by either the permit applicant or the Department for Transport Energy and \\\\nInfrastructure when HVP's were issued for 'fixed-term' operations. \\\\nThe investigation also found that the Stop sign assembly had been moved from its original position \\\\n(3.5 m from the rail line) to its position at the time of the occurrence (9.1 m from the rail line) \\\\nsometime during the upgrade of the level crossing.

The impact speed was 21.9 km/h \\\\nand the track vehicle was pushed back 25 metres. There were no injuries as a result \\\\nof this accident and damage was limited to the fro nt end of the track vehicle. \\\\nThe track vehicle, with three track workers on board, had arrived on the main line at \\\\nGreenbank moments before the arrival of the Sydney bound train and was going to \\\\nthe take-off point to be removed from the rail track for road operation. The \\\\napproaching train was seen and heard by the track workers however they thought \\\\nthey would reach the take -off point and remove the track vehicle before the train \\\\narrived. When they realised that they could not, they escaped from the vehicle \\\\nbefore the collision. \\\\nThe two-man train crew of the Sydney bound train were travelling on a proceed \\\\nsignal and had made a routine brake application in preparedness for the mandatory \\\\nstop at the Greenbank staff hut 5 . As the Greenbank staff station yard cam e into \\\\nview they saw the track vehicle and made an emergency application of the train \\\\nbrakes 246 metres from the point of impact. \\\\nThe train had departed Acacia Ridge under Rail Vehicle Detection authority to \\\\ntravel to Greenbank where the safeworking system changed to electric staff 6. \\\\nThe track vehicle was travelling from Bromelton to Greenbank on a routine track \\\\ninspection on the authority of a Track Occupancy Authority (TOA). This TOA \\\\nconsisted of an electric staff and implied verbal authority to proceed w ithin the \\\\nGreenbank staff station yard limits to the take -off point. \\\\nThe potential for simultaneous arrival at Greenbank had not been detected by the \\\\nQR south-west train controller when developing the train graph. Distractions \\\\nattributed to teaching a tra inee controller and ambiguous communication regarding \\\\nthe departure time of train 5BS7 contributed to this oversight. This ambiguous \\\\ncommunication resulted in the train controller believing that the train would not \\\\ndepart before 0945. However, it was inten ded that 0945 would be the latest \\\\ndeparture time. \\\\n1 Acacia Ridge - A southern suburb of Brisbane, site of a major rail freight terminal. \\\\n2 Track vehicle - A vehicle, usually self propel led, used mainly for inspecting and maintaining \\\\ninfrastructure.

This issue is not considered important and \\\\n- 25  -\\\\n\\\\n&lt;&lt; Page 26 &gt;&gt;\\\\nwould probably not have contributed to the accident. Migration to the new standard \\\\nhas not been retrospective and therefore retention of existing signage is not \\\\nuncommon. \\\\nDuring the investigation it was noted that the W7-4 sign was correctly sited as \\\\nprescribed by the standard. However, it was observed that the sign was almost \\\\ndirectly opposite the motorist's place of residence and may not have been seen as \\\\nshe drove towards the Edith Street crossing.  All road markings were visible even \\\\nthough the 'Rail' and 'X' (crossing) were faded and required repainting. The stop \\\\nbar adjacent the flashing lights was clearly evident. The W7-4 sign, 'Rail' and 'X', \\\\nis principally intended to warn motorists who are unfamiliar with the local \\\\ntopography and provides information regarding the presence of an upcoming \\\\nprotected level crossing. As the motorist was familiar with the local area and had \\\\ntraversed the Edith Street level crossing on many occasions, her need to be pre-\\\\nwarned regarding the proximity of the level crossing should not have been an issue. \\\\nIt was evident that the HRCC did not have a system in place for regular inspection \\\\nof level crossings in the shire.  It is concluded that road markings and signage were \\\\nnot factors that would have contributed to the accident, however the HRCC should \\\\nensure that road markings and signage are regularly inspected and maintained \\\\nApproach sighting \\\\nA site inspection of the crossing established that the flashing lights generally \\\\nprovide good coverage of the approaches, which includes road traffic coming from \\\\nthe west along",
         " Edith Street. However, the curvature of Edith Street limits the \\\\nsighting distances from the western approach to approximately 80 m (Fig. 16). \\\\nFigure 16:\\\\t 'Visibility Diagram'. Unobstructed sighting available at a distance \\\\nof approximately 80 metres from level crossing \\\\nObstructed view \\\\nPartial view \\\\nClear view \\\\n- 26  -\\\\n\\\\n&lt;&lt; Page 27 &gt;&gt;\\\\nGiven the relatively low road speeds, 50 km/h, the 80 m sighting distance provides \\\\nadequate braking distance for road traffic. At the time of day when the accident \\\\noccurred, 1213, the sun was approximately 7 to 8 degrees east of true north and at \\\\nan altitude of approximately 38 degrees. Reflection and ghosting off the flashing \\\\nlight lens surfaces was unlikely to have affected their visibility for an approaching \\\\nmotorist. \\\\nFrom the train driver's perspective, any improvement in the sighting distance by the \\\\nremoval of trees in the approach to this level crossing is unlike ly to have been \\\\nbeneficial at least in terms of the train driver's ability to stop the  train. \\\\nFor the driver of locomotive G535, when approaching the Edith Street level \\\\ncrossing, sighting of east bound road traffic was only available at a distance of 200 -\\\\n250 m from the crossing. At this distance when travelling at a speed of 100 km/h, \\\\nthe train was just 9 seconds from the crossing. Allowing for the train driver's \\\\nreaction time of approximately two seconds and the train braking dynamics, the \\\\nlocomotive would have been at or near the crossing just as the emergency braking \\\\ncame into effect. This conclusion is reinforced by the data extracted from the \\\\nHasler Log (locomotive data logger). \\\\nIt is concluded that approach sighting was not a factor that contributed to the \\\\naccident. \\\\nHardware, control circuits, test and maintenance records \\\\nThe hardware at Edith Street level crossing was consistent with the Association of \\\\nAmerican Railroads (AAR) requisites for highway grade crossing signals and is \\\\ntypical of that used throughout Australia. The lenses and parabolic reflectors were \\\\nclean and provided a nominal optical spread of 30 degrees and vertical deflection of \\\\n15 degrees. All globes were functioning at the time of the accident and provided \\\\nmaximum illumination. \\\\nThe Edith Street level crossing was regularly10 tested by a track supervisor for \\\\ncorrect operation in accordance with ARTC contract requirements. The last test \\\\nbefore the accident was at 1348 on Wednesday 10 August 2005. Results of this test \\\\nindicated that the crossing was operating correctly. \\\\nThe level crossing was also regularly maintained in accordance with prescribed \\\\nARTC/WI contract/maintenance requirements. Maintenance was last performed on \\\\nthe 19 July 2006. No system anomalies were identified. \\\\nA physical inspection of the site established that there was no evidence of \\\\nvandalism or graffiti that may have rendered any part of the warning system \\\\nineffective. \\\\nTests undertaken following the accident established that the equipment was \\\\noperating correctly; there was no evidence to suggest that there was any circuit \\\\ndesign deficiency or system fault that would have resulted in the incorrect operation \\\\nof the crossing. \\\\n10 The crossing was being tested approximately every three days. \\\\n- 27  -\\\\n\\\\n&lt;&lt; Page 28 &gt;&gt;\\\\nCTC (Centralised Train Control) event logging \\\\nCentralised Train Control data covering the period 1034:24 through to 1259:59 on \\\\n11 August 2005 was made available to the ATSB for review and analysis. \\\\nThe replay files pertinent to this accident were extracted with relevant information \\\\nbeing analysed to identify whether there were any unusual occurrences in the lead-\\\\nup to or during the accident. A review of this data established that No. 6 signal, \\\\nwhich controls train movements into the Horsham yard was cleared for locomotive \\\\nG535 at 1116:53, well in advance of the movement. No. 6 signal remained clear for \\\\nthe entire period that G535 approached the crossing and was correctly restored to \\\\nstop by the train movement. The Murtoa to Horsham approach indicator became \\\\noccupied at 1205:48, the Edith Street level crossing commenced operating at \\\\n1211:30 and correctly ceased operating at 1211:52 after locomotive G535 had \\\\ncleared the crossing. During the period 1211:30 through to 1211:52 the re was no \\\\nrecorded evidence that would suggest any abnormal operation of the crossing. \\\\nRTU (Remote Terminal Unit) event logging \\\\nThe Edith Street level crossing RTU data was downloaded for the period 1000:00 \\\\nthrough to 1917:58 a nd provided to the ATSB for analysis. \\\\nAs part of the data capture process, the RTU measures the train's approach warning \\\\ntime based on when the flashing lights commence operation, through to the time \\\\nwhen the train cleared the Edith Street crossing. At the time of the accident, the \\\\nRTU recorded the level crossing as operating continuously from 1211:30 to \\\\n1211:5411, the entire period G535 approached the level crossing. \\\\nWitness accounts \\\\nSeveral witnesses observed the level crossing to be operating correctly as the train \\\\nand motor vehicle approached the Edith Street crossing. \\\\nFrom available witness statements it is concluded that the level crossing was \\\\noperating at the time of the accident.  This is corroborated by on site testing that \\\\nfound that the level crossing equipment was operating correctly and data available \\\\nfrom the CTC and RTU event loggers. \\\\n11\\\\t Subtle timing differences exist between the CTC and RTU data timings.  This occurs as a result of \\\\nslight differences in clock synchronisation, data source, eg lamp current compared to relay contact \\\\nand recording of data remotely (CTC) compared to locally (RTU). The important observation is \\\\nthat the operation of the crossing was continuous from initial level crossing activation through to \\\\nthe flashing lights and bell switching off. \\\\n- 28  -\\\\n\\\\n&lt;&lt; Page 29 &gt;&gt;</td>\\n      <td>ATSB_r_2005_004</td>\\n      <td>2005</td>\\n      <td>1</td>\\n      <td>ATSB</td>\\n      <td>Level Crossing</td>\\n      <td>2005004</td>\\n      <td>https://www.atsb.gov.au/publications/investigation_reports/2005/rair/rair2005004</td>\\n      <td>report_section</td>\\n      <td>0.820003</td>\\n    </tr>\\n    <tr>\\n      <td>ATSB_3.2</td>\\n      <td>3.2 Emergency evacuation \\\\nContributing safety factors \\\\n\\u2022\\\\t The dispatcher informed the flight crew that there were sparks, smoke and fire \\\\nemitting from the right engine.

The party stopped at Y arrawonga overnight and was scheduled to return at \\\\n1100 the next day. Due to the late running of the train the previous night and the crew requiring \\\\na minimum rest period of eleven hours, the train departed at 1142, 42 minutes late. The driver \\\\nhad received the track authority from a train controller at 0948. \\\\nThe train progressed along the line towards Benalla, passing through several regional towns, \\\\ncr\\\\nossing approximately 38 level crossings. The driver sounded the train whistle regularly when \\\\napproaching these crossings and to acknowledge interested passers-by. \\\\nApproaching Benalla, about 4 km north of the Benalla Station, the broad gauge track runs in a \\\\n167 deg\\\\nrees (T) direction before entering the transition of a curve about 3.5 km north of the \\\\nstation. This curve of about 500 m in length has a radius of about 805 m, with the exit from the \\\\ncurve about 3 km from the station and about 1760 m from Saleyards level crossing.

At this point, the track curves over a short distance of about 200 m (with radius 805 \\\\nm) to a heading of about 177 degrees. \\\\nBased on the train recorder, two minutes before the collision train 8382 was travelling at \\\\n39 km/h (10.83 m/s), gradually increasing to 48 km/h (13.33 m/s), and the locomotive was 1600 \\\\nm from Saleyards level crossing. The locomotive crossed Racecourse Road level crossing \\\\n45 seconds before the collision. \\\\nFrom the cab the fireman (on the right side of the cab) may have seen the B-double ahead as it \\\\nt\\\\nravelled parallel with the track. There is no reason why this should have caused any concern. \\\\nAlso it is probable that no anxiety was caused when the B-double turned into the crossing, the \\\\nlikely assumption being that the B-double would come to a stop to allow the train to clear the \\\\ncrossing. It would have only been in the last seconds that there would have been a realisation \\\\nthat the B-double was not going to stop. \\\\nThe Greenfreight B-double truck had departed Avenel fully loaded with flour. The driver \\\\nint\\\\nended to stop for a short period in a residential area of Benalla. Approaching Benalla the \\\\ndriver had followed the approved B-double route around the township onto the Midland \\\\nHighway, turning right into Racecourse Road, right into Gillies Street running parallel to the \\\\nrailway line, and finally left into Saleyards Road Level crossing. See appendices 8.4 and 8.5 for \\\\ndetails of approved B-double routes in the Benalla area. \\\\nAt Gillies Road (670 m north of Saleyards level crossing) the truck would have to reduce speed \\\\nand engage a lo\\\\nw gear to turn through 90 degrees onto Gillies Road and start to travel in a \\\\nsoutherly direction parallel to the rail track.

The derailment of the number three wheel of bogie VXSC 15611 was caused by\\\\nexcessive lateral acceleration combined with rapid loading and unloading due to\\\\nwagon body and bogie dynamics that resulted in transient forces at the\\\\nwheel/rail interface that acted laterally and vertically respectively.\\\\n2. The excessive lateral acceleration and wagon",
         " body and bogie dynamics were\\\\ncaused by a combination of the alignment, radius, vertical profile, rail profile\\\\nand track formation of the turnout and the estimated speed exceedence of the\\\\nrear of train 6SM9V .\\\\n3. Based on the commencement position of train 6SM9V and the normalised\\\\nreading obtained from the Hasler data logger of G533, the rear of train 6SM9V\\\\ntravelled through the southern turnout at 47 kph. This was an exceedence of\\\\n17.5 per cent of the permitted speed of 40 kph.\\\\n4. The countdown meter of the lead locomotive was recording a distance slightly\\\\ngreater than that travelled. This would lead to the driver receiving a slightly\\\\npremature indication that the rear of the train was clear of the southern turnout\\\\nat Alumatta.\\\\n5. The power to weight ratio of train 6SM9V was relatively high at \\\\n3.66 horsepower to tonne. The drag forces exerted by the derailed bogie at the\\\\nrear of the train would therefore have been difficult to detect.\\\\n56\\\\n\\\\n&lt;&lt; Page 57 &gt;&gt;\\\\n6. A correlation of data from the AK Car run in December 2003 revealed that the\\\\nsouthern turnout at Alumatta was not in compliance with the minimum\\\\nstandards contained in CEC 8/86 in terms of 3.5 metre twist. This twist was\\\\nrecorded in the vicinity of the point of climb and constituted an 'A ' exceedence.\\\\n7. This twist equated to a rate of change of track cross level that was marginal in\\\\nterms of the calculated capabilities of the wagon bogies.\\\\n8. The design radius of the southern turnout at Alumatta was 219 metres. This had\\\\nsteadily deteriorated to 129 metres at the time of the derailment. Based on\\\\nradius alone, the posted speed of 40 kph was about 31 per cent in excess of the\\\\ncalculated recommended design speed as calculated at table 5.2 of the draft\\\\nARTC annotated NCoP DIRN Track, Civil and Electrical Infrastructure.\\\\n9. Based on the radius of 129 metres alone, at 47 kph the rear of train 6SM9V\\\\nexceeded the calculated recommended design speed as formulated at table 5.5 of\\\\nthe draft ARTC annotated NCoP DIRN Track, Civil and Electrical Infrastructure\\\\nby about 54 per cent.\\\\n10. No remedial works were undertaken in response to the horizontal alignment\\\\nexceedences identified by the track recording car inspection 11 December 2003.\\\\nThe faults were coded as priority two (P2) which, in accordance with the table\\\\nthat correlates the AK Car outputs with the former EM Car and the Victorian\\\\nCECs, required an inspection within seven days and remedial action within 28\\\\ndays.\\\\n11. The horizontal alignment exceedences recorded by the AK Car in December\\\\n2003 in accordance with the table that correlates AK Car data outputs with the\\\\nformer EM Car and the Victorian CECs require a P2 priority response. For\\\\ncomparative purposes, the draft ARTC annotated NCoP DIRN Track, Civil and\\\\nElectrical Infrastructure calculates the same exceedence as a P1 priority fault\\\\ncode thereby requiring inspection within 24 hours and remedial action within\\\\nseven days.\\\\n12. There was an unvalidated correlation between the fault priority response codes\\\\ncontained in the AK Car defect and response table and the fault priority codes\\\\nof the CECs. This led to the horizontal alignment exceedence at the southern\\\\nturnout at Alumatta being categorised as a CEC 'C' fault in lieu of a P2 fault. A\\\\nCEC 'C' fault is termed a 'base level exceedence' and places no time limit for\\\\ninspection or rectification.\\\\n13. The exceedence (Maximo) report generated as a result of the AK Car run on \\\\n11 December 2003 for the information of the track maintenance contractor\\\\ncontained a lesser horizontal alignment exceedence (-48 mm) than the actual\\\\ndata output of the AK Car (-70.25 mm).\\\\n14. No evidence of 'front of train rides' , 'on condition inspections' , 'walking\\\\ninspections' or 'special inspections' during the period March 2003 to March\\\\n2004 was sighted during this investigation. The categories of 'track patrols' and\\\\n'track recorder car runs' were conducted in accordance with the track\\\\nmaintenance contractor's safety management system.\\\\n57\\\\n\\\\n&lt;&lt; Page 58 &gt;&gt;\\\\n15. In general terms the standards applicable to the ARTC leased standard gauge\\\\ntrack between Albury and Melbourne are not clearly defined, properly\\\\ndocumented or understood.\\\\n16. There was a contention that the Victorian CECs are the standards used for\\\\nmaintenance and monitoring of the ARTC leased standard gauge track between\\\\nAlbury and Melbourne, but little evidence was found who support this.\\\\n17.

The train stopped at Wagga Wagga from\\\\n1230 until 1238 to allow another train to pass through on the single main line. The train\\\\ncontinued towards Melbourne passing through Albury at 1430. As the train passed through\\\\nAlbury station, the crew saw the stationary V/Line passenger train 8318 at a platform. The crew,\\\\nwho had travelled this route regularly, knew that the passenger train was shortly due to depart,\\\\nand would follow their train on the adjacent broad gauge line.\\\\nAs train 1SP2N passed through Albury, the driver of train 8318 visually inspected the right side\\\\nof the passing train for problems. This is a standard operating procedure called 'roll by\\\\ninspection' . The driver of train 8318 notified the crew on train 1SP2N, by radio, that the train\\\\nwas complete with no visible problems. The crew on train 1SP2N acknowledged the driver of\\\\n8318.\\\\nAt 1445 train 8318 departed Albury station travelling to Melbourne on the broad gauge line.\\\\nAt approximately 1507, when on the Melbourne side of Chiltern, the driver of train 1SP2N\\\\nnoted that the train jerked suddenly. The crew observed through the locomotive mirrors that\\\\n2 See Chiltern locality map, appendix 8.3.\\\\n3 Centrol is the train control centre for the country Victorian broad gauge system.\\\\n4 Progressive failure of the bearing unit resulted in heating (from friction) of the axle journal. Seizure of the bearing then\\\\nresulted in the journal 'screwing off' the axle.\\\\n5 See appendix 8.2 for a timeline diagram.\\\\n6 All times in this report are in Eastern Summer Time format.\\\\n\\\\n&lt;&lt; Page 6 &gt;&gt;\\\\n6\\\\nwagons were derailing to the field side of the track. The driver applied the emergency train\\\\nbrakes and the train was brought to a stand at 1508:45.\\\\nThe driver of train 1SP2N immediately tried to contact train control in Adelaide by emergency\\\\ncall, to advise them of the derailment. Twenty seven seconds later at 1509:12 contact was\\\\nestablished with the ARTC train control centre using the 'A ' panel radio. At the same time the\\\\nsecond driver was trying to call the driver of the passenger train 8318 using the end - to - end\\\\n(local) radio on 'B' panel. The second driver made several attempts to contact the driver of train\\\\n8318, without apparent success. At about 1510 the second driver alighted with a hand - held\\\\nradio and started to walk to protect the rear of the train. As he walked along the field side of the\\\\ntrain he continued to try and contact the driver of train 8318 using the hand-held radio.\\\\nAfter the ARTC train controller in Adelaide completed his conversation with the driver from\\\\ntrain 1SP2N, he momentarily left the workstation to report the derailment to his direct\\\\nsupervisor. He then returned and made two attempts to contact Centrol, the train control centre\\\\nfor train 8318, both attempts were unsuccessful.\\\\nAt about 1511, as train 8318 approached the left curve transition travelling at a permitted train\\\\nspeed of 115 km/h, the driver noticed a fire beside the track and dust flying up adjacent to train\\\\n1SP2N. The driver of 8318 applied the emergency brake to stop his train. As the driver of train\\\\n8318 was taking this action he heard someone on the end - to - end radio. The driver then\\\\nrealised that his line, the broad gauge, was fouled and braced himself for the impact. At about\\\\n1512 train 8318 collided with wreckage from train 1SP2N at a speed of about 80km/h. Train\\\\n8318 derailed and travelled approximately 100 metres before coming to a stand with the\\\\nlocomotive and the two leading carriages derailed in an upright position. The driver left the cab\\\\nto assess the damage and any injury.\\\\nAt 1512:02 Centrol received a call from the Emergency Services 'hotline' . The caller advised of\\\\nfire and smoke near the railway line, next to a stationary train, at Chiltern.\\\\nAt 1512:32 the ARTC train controller made a third attempt to call Centrol but was interrupted\\\\nby an inbound call from 1SP2N, this call lasted 20 seconds. At 1513:02 the ARTC train controller\\\\nattempted a fourth call to Centrol, but a train driver from Dimboola answered. After a short\\\\ndiscussion with the Dimboola driver the train controller ended the call at 1513:42. At 1513:52\\\\nhe initiated a successful fifth call to Centrol, lasting about 60 seconds, in which details about the\\\\nincident were exchanged.\\\\nFrom about 1515, Centrol made repeated attempts to contact the driver of train 8318. During\\\\nthis time the driver was assessing damage to the train and passengers. The driver advised\\\\nWodonga signal box of the collision by a mobile phone requesting emergency services to attend.\\\\nAt 1515:02 the signaller from Wodonga called Centrol and advised of a train derailment.\\\\nAt 1520:33 Centrol called '000' emergency for assistance at the site.\\\\nAt 1525:08 the driver of 8318 advised Centrol of the collision and that emergency services had\\\\narrived. Fuel was leaking from the locomotive, the locomotive and two carriages were derailed,\\\\nand passengers were being detrained.\\\\n7 See appendix 8.1\\\\n\\\\n&lt;&lt; Page 7 &gt;&gt;\\\\n7</td>\\n      <td>ATSB_r_2003_002</td>\\n      <td>2003</td>\\n      <td>1</td>\\n      <td>ATSB</td>\\n      <td>Derailment</td>\\n      <td>2003/002</td>\\n      <td>https://www.atsb.gov.au/publications/investigation_reports/2003/rair/rair2003002</td>\\n      <td>report_section</td>\\n      <td>0.820166</td>\\n    </tr>\\n    <tr>\\n      <td>ATSB_3.2</td>\\n      <td>3.2     Signi\\ufb01cant factors\\\\n1.

Recommendations may be issued in conjunction with\\\\nATSB reports or independently. A safety deficiency may lead to a number of similar\\\\nrecommendations, each issued to a different agency.\\\\nThe ATSB does not have the resources to carry out a full cost-benefit analysis of every\\\\nrecommendation. The cost of any recommendation must always be balanced against its\\\\nbenefits to safety, and aviation safety involves the whole community. Such analysis is a\\\\nmatter for the body to which the recommendation is addressed (for example the Civil\\\\nAviation Safety Authority in consultation with the industry).</td>\\n      <td>ATSB_a_2001_715</td>\\n      <td>2001</td>\\n      <td>0</td>\\n      <td>ATSB</td>\\n      <td>Aircraft control</td>\\n      <td>200105715</td>\\n      <td>https://www.atsb.gov.au/publications/investigation_reports/2001/aair/aair200105715</td>\\n      <td>report_section</td>\\n      <td>0.820166</td>\\n    </tr>\\n    <tr>\\n      <td>ATSB_3.2</td>\\n      <td>3.2 Significant Factors \\\\n \\\\n1.

An undamaged wagon bogie outer spring was found on the eastern side of the\\\\nstandard gauge line, 52.4 metres from the point of derailment. The track markings\\\\nremained reasonably constant until the level crossing at Sandford Road (231.132\\\\nkilometre mark) was encountered. On the asphalt surface of the level crossing there\\\\nwere flange marks to the eastern side of the right rail and some scuff marks on the\\\\nwestern side of the left rail. There were also flange markings on the eastern side of\\\\nthe left rail but these were only evident for the first three metres.\\\\nBetween the Sandford Road level crossing and the Shanley Street level crossing,\\\\nflange marks on the eastern side of the right and left rails were evident. Also, there\\\\nwere intermittent strikes on the timber sleepers from the bogie side frame and\\\\ncomponents.\\\\nFIGURE 4: Shanley Street level crossing, looking south\\\\n7\\\\nDirection of travelDirection of travel\\\\nBogie side frame indents\\\\nindicating shift from east to\\\\nwest side of track\\\\nBogie side frame indents\\\\nindicating shift from east to\\\\nwest side of track\\\\n\\\\n&lt;&lt; Page 8 &gt;&gt;\\\\nAt the Shanley Street level crossing (230.352 kilometre mark) flange marks were\\\\nagain evident on the eastern side of both rails on the asphalt surface. There was also\\\\na significant indent consistent with the initial impact of the right bogie side frame\\\\nas the level crossing was encountered. This indent was on the eastern side of the\\\\nright rail. Then, about half way along this crossing, gouge marks of similar width\\\\nand characteristics appeared on the crossing surface. Immediately beyond this level\\\\ncrossing, commencing at the fourth sleeper, there were marks on the western side of\\\\nthe right rail that were consistent with the heavy impact of the right bogie side\\\\nframe 'bottoming out' after the level crossing had been traversed. It would seem that\\\\nthe right side bogie side frame crossed from the east to the west side of the right rail\\\\nas it traversed this crossing (see figure 4).\\\\nBetween the Shanley Street level crossing and the bridge over Fifteen Mile Creek\\\\n(229.979 kilometre mark) the flange markings were consistent with the four wheels\\\\nbeing derailed to the eastern side of both rails and the bogie side frame dragging\\\\nalong the western side of the right rail.\\\\nAt the bridge over the Fifteen Mile Creek watercourse there were marks indicating\\\\nheavy contact with the concrete bridge abutment and right side of the first timber\\\\ntransom. At the sixth transom the scuff markings on the western side of the right\\\\nrail reappeared. On the eastern side of the right rail there were flange markings\\\\nevery six to 10 transoms. T o the eastern side of the left rail flange marks were\\\\nevident for the length of the bridge, with strike marks from the outer edge of the\\\\nwheel marking the inside edge of the bolts of the transoms.\\\\nFIGURE 5: Damage to concrete abutment and transom\\\\nBetween the bridge over the Fifteen Mile Creek watercourse and Gravel Pit Road at\\\\nthe 229.073 kilometre mark the scuff marks from the bogie side frame remained on\\\\nthe western side of the right rail.

In general, all of the \\\\nbearings showed a visible level of grease discolouration - most clearly evident inside the \\\\nrear caps of the inboard bearings (figure 12) and on the end faces of the outboard \\\\nbearings (figure 13).  Samples of the grease were also taken for particle analysis. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nAfter degreasing, the cage of each bearing was split to release the rollers and all \\\\nsurfaces were closely examined.  The inner race surfaces of the position-three inboard \\\\nbearing and position-four outboard bearing both showed the development of incipient \\\\nspalling damage (figure 14), with the position-four bearing also showing clear evidence \\\\nof static corrosion damage (figu",
         "re 15).  The corrosion or 'water marks' was present in \\\\nparallel transverse bands, with a spacing that equalled the roller separation.  Several \\\\ncorroded areas showed the clear development of associated spalling bands (figure 16).  \\\\nLight corrosion staining was also noted on the outside flange of the position-one outside \\\\nbearing (figure 17). \\\\n \\\\nFig. 10.

The impact speed was 21.9 km/h \\\\nand the track vehicle was pushed back 25 metres. There were no injuries as a result \\\\nof this accident and damage was limited to the fro nt end of the track vehicle. \\\\nThe track vehicle, wi",
         "th three track workers on board, had arrived on the main line at \\\\nGreenbank moments before the arrival of the Sydney bound train and was going to \\\\nthe take-off point to be removed from the rail track for road operation. The \\\\napproaching train was seen and heard by the track workers however they thought \\\\nthey would reach the take -off point and remove the track vehicle before the train \\\\narrived. When they realised that they could not, they escaped from the vehicle \\\\nbefore the collision. \\\\nThe two-man train crew of the Sydney bound train were travelling on a proceed \\\\nsignal and had made a routine brake application in preparedness for the mandatory \\\\nstop at the Greenbank staff hut 5 . As the Greenbank staff station yard cam e into \\\\nview they saw the track vehicle and made an emergency application of the train \\\\nbrakes 246 metres from the point of impact. \\\\nThe train had departed Acacia Ridge under Rail Vehicle Detection authority to \\\\ntravel to Greenbank where the safeworking system changed to electric staff 6. \\\\nThe track vehicle was travelling from Bromelton to Greenbank on a routine track \\\\ninspection on the authority of a Track Occupancy Authority (TOA). This TOA \\\\nconsisted of an electric staff and implied verbal authority to proceed w ithin the \\\\nGreenbank staff station yard limits to the take -off point. \\\\nThe potential for simultaneous arrival at Greenbank had not been detected by the \\\\nQR south-west train controller when developing the train graph. Distractions \\\\nattributed to teaching a tra inee controller and ambiguous communication regarding \\\\nthe departure time of train 5BS7 contributed to this oversight.

The road-\\\\ntrain driver was slightly injured while the two train drivers were shaken but otherwise unhurt. \\\\nTrain 4A13N was conveying four empty fuel tankers for loading at the Mobil fuel depot that is \\\\nabout 1 km beyond the Stirling Street level crossing. The road-train had just departed from the \\\\nAdelaide Brighton Cement Works at Birkenhead with a consignment of cement that was bound for \\\\nRoxby Downs in central SA.  \\\\nThe Stirling Street level crossing is located on the dual gauge Dry Creek to Outer Harbor 'freight \\\\nonly' rail corridor. Stirling Street is a short, sealed, two-way dead end street that provides access to \\\\nbulk fuel and cement facilities in the immediate vicinity.  \\\\nFor about 34 months before the collision, the Port River Expressway Project had been underway on \\\\nthe Dry Creek to Outer Harbor rail corridor. The project included the re-laying of the rail line and \\\\nthe upgrade of the Stirling Street level crossing from passive control ('Stop' sign) to active control \\\\n(flashing lights and boom barriers). These works were only partially completed at the time of the \\\\ncollision.  \\\\nOn the day of the collision, the Stirling Street level crossing was within a worksite that was \\\\nassociated with the Port River Expressway Project. In accordance with the protection measures for \\\\nthe worksite, train 4A13N had been stopped by a flagman about 130 m from the level crossing. \\\\nWhen all personnel and equipment were clear of the track, train 4A13N was given permission to \\\\nproceed into the worksite and over the Stirling Street level crossing. Several witnesses confirmed \\\\nthat, at this time, the locomotive horn was sounded several times and that the locomotive headlight \\\\nwas illuminated.  \\\\nShortly after, the train driver made an emergency application of the train brake when he realised \\\\nthat there was a collision risk at the level crossing with an approaching road-train. Train 4A13N \\\\ncollided with the lead trailer of the road-train almost at the centre of the pneumatic cement tank. \\\\nThe impact speed of both the train and road-train was low (about 15 km/h) but nevertheless \\\\nsufficient to roll the prime mover and the leading trailer onto their sides and to derail the lead bogie \\\\nof the train's locomotive. \\\\nWhile evidence in regard to the sequence of events in the moments before the collision varies \\\\nconsiderably, the investigation concluded that it is likely the road-train did not stop at the Stop sign \\\\nassembly and travelled over the Stirling Street level crossing at a relatively constant speed of about \\\\n15 km/h into the path of train 4A13N. It is very unlikely that the road-train driver stopped at the \\\\nStop sign assembly, but if he did, he displayed poor judgement in electing to accelerate normally \\\\nfrom a position that was effectively blind to oncoming rail traffic. \\\\nThe investigation found that the double trailer road-train did not have a Heavy Vehicle Permit \\\\n(HVP) to operate on Stirling Street at the time of the collision. As such, the owner and driver of the \\\\ndouble trailer road-train did not hold any authority to operate this vehicle over the Stirling Street \\\\nlevel crossing. In addition, the ARTC had not recently been approached to issue clearances for other \\\\nlevel crossings in SA by either the permit applicant or the Department for Transport Energy and \\\\nInfrastructure when HVP's were issued for 'fixed-term' operations. \\\\nThe investigation also found that the Stop sign assembly had been moved from its original position \\\\n(3.5 m from the rail line) to its position at the time of the occurrence (9.1 m from the rail line) \\\\nsometime during the upgrade of the level crossing. Similarly, the Stop line (pavement marking) had \\\\n-  viii  -</td>\\n      <td>ATSB_r_2008_001</td>\\n      <td>2008</td>\\n      <td>1</td>\\n      <td>ATSB</td>\\n      <td>Level Crossing</td>\\n      <td>RO-2008-001</td>\\n      <td>https://www.atsb.gov.au/publications/investigation_reports/2008/rair/ro-2008-001</td>\\n      <td>report_section</td>\\n      <td>0.786720</td>\\n    </tr>\\n    <tr>\\n      <td>ATSB_pviii.2</td>\\n      <td>1 The 24-hour clock is used in this report to descri be the local time of day, Central Standard Time \\\\n(CST), as particular events occurred. \\\\n2 Track kilometre points are measured from Coonamia (0.000 km) via Port Augusta (92.000 km) to \\\\nWhyalla (166.591km). \\\\n-  viii  -</td>\\n      <td>ATSB_r_2007_003</td>\\n      <td>2007</td>\\n      <td>1</td>\\n      <td>ATSB</td>\\n      <td>Derailment</td>\\n      <td>RO-2007-003</td>\\n      <td>https://www.atsb.gov.au/publications/investigation_reports/2007/rair/2007-003</td>\\n      <td>report_section</td>\\n      <td>0.786720</td>\\n    </tr>\\n    <tr>\\n      <td>ATSB_pviii.2</td>\\n      <td>Occurrence: accident or incident. \\\\nSafety factor: an event or condition that increases safety risk.

Immediately prior to 8620 departing Kilmore East, the network control officer (NCO) \\\\nadvised the driver that they were going to be the first train through Wallan Loop in the past \\\\n72 hours.

A placard was only required to be \\\\ndisplayed on the aircraft's instrument panel for any GNSS \\\\nequipment not approved for IFR or by Airworthiness \\\\nDirective on some units that subsequently had approvals \\\\nwithdrawn. \\\\nPilots who flew the aircraft reported that on at \\\\nleast one previous occasi on while flying an RNAV \\\\n(GNSS) NPA, they had observed a disparity \\\\nbetween the visual position of the aircraft and the \\\\npublished track, when established on a final \\\\napproach to the runway.

The \\\\nincompatibility of hardwa re connections between \\\\nthe GNSS navigation receiver display unit (RDU) \\\\nand the electronic horizontal situation indicator on \\\\nthe pilot's instrument panel, resulted in less than \\\\nthe required fidelity of course deviation \\\\nindications.  \\\\nAlthough some documentation of the navigation \\\\nreceiver's installation was incomplete and there \\\\nwere unanswered questions about the approval \\\\nand operational status of the installed navigation \\\\nequipment, the significant safety issue concerned \\\\nthe operation of an aircraft under the instrument \\\\nflight rules (IFR), during which RNAV (GNSS) NPAs \\\\nwere frequently flown. \\\\nThe aircraft had been flown for a number years by \\\\nmany professional pilots who believed that the \\\\naircraft was approved for RNAV (GNSS) NPAs and \\\\nwho had neither ascertained the operational \\\\nstatus of the navigation equipment installed in the \\\\naircraft from the aircraft's flight manual \\\\nsupplement (FMS), nor attempted to resolve the \\\\nreason for at least one previous unexplained \\\\ntracking error while flying an RNAV (GNSS) NPA in \\\\nvisual meteorological conditions. \\\\nAlthough the FMS correctly specified the approved \\\\nprocedures, confusion may have arisen from the \\\\n'Approach' designation of the TNL2000 Approach \\\\nRDU and the capability of the RDU to provide \\\\nnavigation for RNAV (GNSS) NPAs.

The trading pattern on which the Spirit of Enterprise  was engaged was demanding. \\\\nSignificant maintenance work had i mproved the speed to an extent that the ship was \\\\ncapable of the required schedule speed.  If required, Pacifica had a number of options \\\\navailable to manage cargo, port calls, port time and ship use to make up time should \\\\nthe ship fall behind its schedule.  \\\\n \\\\n2.  The master and deck officers maintained navigational watches at sea and the deck \\\\nofficers maintained the cargo watches in port while the master attended to other duties. \\\\nIn isolation the watchkeeping routine would allow for appropriate rest periods.  T he \\\\nmaster's requirement for all 3 watchkeepers at arrival and departure stations meant \\\\nthat any 2 of them were working in their off - watch periods at those times.  The \\\\nofficers also had routine tasks that could only be undertaken when not on watch.  \\\\n \\\\n\\\\n&lt;&lt; Page 11 &gt;&gt;\\\\n \\\\nReport 01 - 205 page 11  \\\\n3.  With in the schedule were 2 longer passages, namely Lyttelton to Tauranga and \\\\nAuckland to Lyttelton, which gave the officers some respite while keeping routine sea \\\\nwatches.  \\\\n \\\\n4.  Such a routine over a 2 - week period would be tiring and the officers acknowledged a \\\\nreduction in performance over the duty roster.  At the time of this incident the officers \\\\nwere working 3 - week rosters.  While this was done to enable required courses to be \\\\ncompleted and was followed by a 3 - week leave period, it did mean that the reduction  \\\\nin individual performance levels was probably increased.  \\\\n \\\\n5.  The master kept the second mate on the bridge to assist for the transit of the upper \\\\nharbour but released him once past the Halfway Islands.  Although the master \\\\nprobably released the second mat e for fatigue management purposes, he nevertheless \\\\ndeprived himself of assistance to monitor the passage through the lower harbour.  The \\\\nmaster's use of the available officers showed a lack of good crew resource \\\\nmanagement.  The chief mate was expected to arrive shortly to relieve the second \\\\nmate and in any case the lower harbour transit would only have taken about another 35 \\\\nminutes.   \\\\n \\\\n6.  On the second attempted transit of the lower harbour, the master was assisted on the \\\\nbridge by the chief mate.  Althou gh he was the master's senior deck officer, he was \\\\nalso the one who had worked the most hours.  The master might have been better \\\\nassisted on the bridge by the second mate who, although he had worked for about 6 \\\\nhours, had done considerably fewer hours tha n the chief mate.  \\\\n \\\\n7.

fishing vessels. These include:\\n\\n1. **Training and Qualifications**:\\n   - **Report ID MO-2021-203 (2021):** There are indications that the requirement for fishing deckhands to be sufficiently trained in watchkeeping is not being fully adhered to by some owners of New Zealand's under 24-metre fishing fleet. ([MO-2021-203](https://www.taic.org.nz/inquiry/MO-2021-203))\\n\\n2. **Watchkeeping Practices**:\\n   - **Report ID MO-2004-209/2006-203 (2004/2006):** The lack of a working watchkeeping alarm for a single-handed wheelhouse operation was noted, affecting vigilance and safety. ([MO-2004-209](https://www.taic.org.nz/inquiry/MO-2004-209), [MO-2006-203](https://www.taic.org.nz/inquiry/MO-2006-203))\\n\\n3. **Crew Qualifications**:\\n   - **Report ID MO-2001-216 (2001):** The watchkeeper held no maritime qualification and lacked formal training in vessel recognition and collision avoidance, leading to insufficient capability to handle navigational challenges.

This includes ensuring compliance with conventions established by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and the International Labour Organization (ILO).\\n\\n2. **Inspection Process**: Flag State inspections are conducted to assess the overall condition of a vessel, including its structure, machinery, safety equipment, and living conditions for crew members. Inspectors verify that the vessel complies with relevant safety and environmental standards.\\n\\n3. **Certification and Documentation**: Ships must carry valid certification and documentation to demonstrate compliance with international conventions, such as the International Safety Management (ISM) Code, MARPOL (International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships), and SOLAS (Safety of Life at Sea).\\n\\n4. **Flag State Control**: The flag state has the authority to sanction ships that do not comply with regulations. This may involve detaining the vessel, revoking its registration, or imposing fines.\\n\\n5. **Continuous Monitoring**: Flag States conduct regular inspections and audits to ensure ongoing compliance.

Here's a comparison:\\n\\n### Flag State Inspections\\n\\n1. **Conducted By**: The flag state, which is the country under whose flag the vessel is registered.\\n\\n2. **Purpose**: To ensure that ships comply with the maritime regulations and conventions to which the flag state is a party, including safety, pollution prevention, and crew welfare.\\n\\n3. **Scope**: Comprehensive oversight of a vessel's compliance with international and national standards throughout its operation, including structural integrity, safety equipment, and certification.\\n\\n4. **Frequency**: Regular and could be more frequent depending on the flag state's policies and the vessel's compliance history.\\n\\n5. **Authority**: The flag state has the authority to enforce regulations, sanction non-compliance, and ensure continuous compliance with conventions like SOLAS, MARPOL, and ISM Code.\\n\\n### Port State Inspections\\n\\n1. **Conducted By**: The port state, i.e., the country where the vessel is currently in port, regardless of where it is registered.\\n\\n2. **Purpose**: To act as a second layer of verification to ensure that visiting foreign ships comply with international safety and environmental standards.\\n\\n3. **Scope**: Focused examination of a vessel's compliance with international conventions like SOLAS, MARPOL, and STCW (Standards of Training, Certification, and Watchkeeping for Seafarers). Inspections are often more targeted, based on risk profiles and previous inspection records.\\n\\n4. **Frequency**: Usually risk-based and not necessarily regular, concentrating more on vessels with poor performance history or first-time visitors to a port.\\n\\n5. **Authority**: The port state control (PSC) officers have the authority to detain ships that fail to meet international standards, to ensure safety and prevent pollution until corrective action is taken.\\n\\n### Key Differences\\n\\n- **Authority**: Flag states monitor their registered vessels worldwide, while port states inspect any foreign vessels visiting their ports.\\n- **Objective**: Flag states ensure compliance as part of their responsibility to international conventions, whereas port states act as a secondary check and to protect their own waters.\\n- **Operations**: Flag states have a continuous role throughout the vessel's lifecycle, whereas port state inspections are opportunistic, occurring when a vessel is in a foreign port.\\n\\nBoth inspection types are foundational to the global maritime regulatory framework, working together to uphold safety and environmental protection standards in international waters.\", \"options\": null}]",

Complementing existing guidance material (Health and Safety: A Guide; \\\\nFishSAFE Health and Safety Guidelines; various leaflets) with additional \\\\nmaterial including a comprehensive resource to support owners in the \\\\ndevelopment of their SSM systems, specific fatigue management \\\\nmaterial, and health and safety guidelines for passenger and non-\\\\npassenger operations.  This additional material is being progressively \\\\nreleased through until December 2007 in association with targeted \\\\ntraining material; \\\\n3. Increasing the amount and quality of formal and informal training and \\\\neducation that is available to all those working in the system, including \\\\nMNZ and SSM Company staff, surveyors, owners and operators.  This \\\\ntraining will be supported by the development of a mentor network \\\\nutilising experienced industry participants to provide support and advice \\\\nto their peers;  \\\\n4. Reviewing the current capacity and quality of service delivery by both \\\\nMNZ and SSM Companies in the area of SSM and comparing this with \\\\nrequirements in order to identify and address necessary areas for \\\\nimprovement; \\\\n5. Allocating additional resources to the SSM team within MNZ to allow for \\\\nmore responsive contact with industry and other stakeholders, along with \\\\nthe provision of personalised assistance where required to owners and \\\\noperators; and \\\\n6.

The crack was ground \\\\nout but more cracks appeared in the shaft after the ship departed Taharoa.  Eventually the ship was \\\\ntowed back to Japan.  Maritime NZ conducted its own investigation and published a report with its \\\\nfindings of the incident. \\\\nIn its findings of the preliminary report, Maritime NZ noted that the crack in the shaft was probably \\\\nfrom a defect when the shaft was originally cast. \\\\nOne of the key conditions that the report noted was: \\\\nOf the vessel's nine holds only five, No.'s 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 were used for loading \\\\nironsands, leaving No.'s 2, 4, 6 and 8 empty. The approximate depth of each \\\\nhold is about 24m.  When fully loaded, the ullages at the loading holds (the cargo \\\\nis loaded as a slurry, which is gradually dewatered on the passenger to Japan) is \\\\nabout 12metres.  Effectively on departure when the vessel is fully loaded, the \\\\nholds are still only half full.  According to the harbour master/pilot at Taharoa, \\\\nhe has on occasion taken the vessel off the SPM [single buoy mooring](for \\\\nexample because of bad weather) when tonnages have varied from 50,000 \\\\nthrough to 120,000.  On none of these occasions was the safety of the vessel \\\\nconsidered to be at risk for reasons such as free surface effect from the slurry \\\\ncargo. \\\\n \\\\nAt the time the ship had de-watered on the single buoy mooring for approximately 7 hours before its \\\\ndeparture. The report did not state whether there was still free water lying on top of the iron sand at the \\\\ntime of the incident or on the other occasions mentioned. \\\\n22 September 2003: Mooring rope failure at single buoy mooring \\\\nOn 22 September 2003, a mooring rope failure while the Taharoa Express was loading at the single \\\\nbuoy mooring in Taharoa required the ship to leave the port before loading had been completed. \\\\nBoth NZ Steel Mining and Maritime NZ conducted independent investigations into the failure of the \\\\nmooring rope.  In October 2003, Maritime NZ held a meeting with NZ Steel Mining; the purpose of that \\\\nmeeting was to prevent a future incident and take a wider view of the risks associated with operations at \\\\nthe port.  The mooring rope was inspected by the local agent of the manufacturer.  The Maritime NZ \\\\nreport recommended that another independent assessment of the rope be made and that a spare rope \\\\nwithin its life cycle be used for the next load, until a new replacement had been delivered. \\\\n22 February 2004: Engine failure at single buoy mooring \\\\nIn February 2004, the Taharoa Express suffered an engine start failure while it was mooring at the buoy \\\\nat Taharoa.  The ship was able to deploy its anchors and later leave the harbour under its own power to \\\\neffect repairs.  The ship safely moored at the buoy to load cargo 3 days later. \\\\nThis incident was investigated by Maritime NZ and a report with recommendations published.  One of a \\\\nnumber of recommendations made by Maritime NZ was that a risk analysis should be undertaken of the \\\\nship mooring at the buoy when part loaded.  Maritime NZ also identified to Hachiuma Steamship \\\\nCompany Limited, the ship management company, deficiencies in the ISM of the ship and \\\\nrecommended a drift study be completed of the ship in varying weather conditions.  The ship \\\\nmanagement company after this incident started work on an \\\"operation procedures manual at Port \\\\nTaharoa\\\" for the Taharoa Express; the first issue of this was subsequently published in April 2004.\\\\n\\\\n&lt;&lt; Page 84 &gt;&gt;\\\\nReport 07-207, Page 84 \\\\nAppendix 3 Bulk carrier casualty statistics \\\\n \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n&lt;&lt; Page 85 &gt;&gt;\\\\n \\\\n  Report 07-207, Page 85  \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n&lt;&lt; Page 86 &gt;&gt;\\\\nReport 07-207, Page 86 \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n&lt;&lt; Page 87 &gt;&gt;\\\\n \\\\n  Report 07-207, Page 87  \\\\nAppendix 4 IMO Circular DSC/ Circ.14 Compliance with the bulk code \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n&lt;&lt; Page 88 &gt;&gt;\\\\nReport 07-207, Page 88 \\\\n \\\\nAppendix 5 Port safety code risk assessment guidelines \\\\n \\\\nIn the port safety code risk assessment guidelines, an explanation of stage 2, the hazard identification \\\\nprocess, is outlined in section 3.1.2 and is quoted below: \\\\nThe process of hazard identification is likely to begin soon after stage 1 has \\\\ncommenced and a preliminary list should have become available almost as a \\\\ndirect output from this stage.  Hazard identification is, in many ways, the most \\\\ncritical of the steps involved in the risk assessment process.  An overlooked \\\\nhazard is more likely to introduce error into the overall risk assessment of a port \\\\nor harbour, than an accurate assessment of frequency or consequence.  In many \\\\ncases, errors made in assessing consequence and frequency can cancel each other \\\\nout over the full spectrum of incidents, whereas the omission of a hazard results \\\\nin an underestimation of the overall risk profile.  Moreover, important risk \\\\ncontrol may not be introduced to properly manage the risk, resulting in an \\\\naccident waiting to happen. \\\\n \\\\nThe facilitator of a HAZID meeting is the key to a successful delivery of the \\\\nhazard information and the role is often combined with that of the chairman.  \\\\nThere are few areas where the risk assessment can truly benefit from a specialist, \\\\nbut this is one of them.  An experienced HAZID chairman can make a real \\\\ndifference in the delivery of the information from participants.  All ports and \\\\nharbours intending to undertake their own risk assessments are strongly \\\\nrecommended to consider as a minimum, using a specialist to facilitate their \\\\nHAZID.  All stakeholders should participate in the HAZID at some stage in its \\\\nagenda.  It is vital to involve regular harbour users at this stage. \\\\n \\\\nThe aim of the exercise is to identify all hazards; even those managed by existing \\\\nrisk control measures.  Within this stage, one or more structured meetings \\\\n(HAZID meetings) with those having experience of vessel movements and \\\\nberthing in the location should be held.  It is strongly advisable to have some \\\\nform of independent attendance at the HAZID meeting, which could be expertise \\\\nfrom a neighbouring council or port company.  This approach recognises that the \\\\npeople best placed to identify hazards are often personnel working within the \\\\nport or harbour, but that a \\\"new pair of eyes\\\" also notices items of significance \\\\nthat are accepted as normal in the system.  The benefits provided by those \\\\noutside pair of eyes are very important to the success of the risk assessment.  It is \\\\nperhaps obvious that risk assessments undertaken totally in house do not \\\\ngenerally address all the issues, some of which will be related to problems that \\\\nthe organisation with the responsibility has hesitation in addressing. \\\\nThe HAZID process should be conducted on an Incident Category basis, across \\\\neach area of the port or harbour.  It should systematically consider vessel types, \\\\noperations and interfaces appropriate to each area.  The approach will be to \\\\nundertake Hazard Identification on a geographical basis, followed by a number \\\\nof smaller meetings concentrating on specific areas and assessment of specific \\\\noperations. \\\\nHazards should be identified initially on a generic basis and then added in order \\\\nto consider scenarios specific to different areas of the port or harbour.\\\\n\\\\n&lt;&lt; Page 89 &gt;&gt;\\\\n \\\\n  Report 07-207, Page 89  \\\\nAppendix 6 Risk assessment for Port Taharoa \\\\nOriginal scoring of hazards 9 and 10 by Maritime NZ after harbourmasters' hazard identification meeting \\\\nin April 2004.

Due to deteriorating weather the ship had to leave \\\\nthe SBM and the decision was made to seek a safe haven at Tasman Bay. \\\\n \\\\nNumbers 1,3,5,7 and 9 cargo holds all contained part loads of iron sand with water on \\\\ntop.  Number 6 cargo hold which was full of water ballast during the previous ballast \\\\nvoyage was still about 2/3 full at the time of the incident (the operating instructions on \\\\nboard state number 6 ballast hold is to be full or empty when the ship is at sea).  Other \\\\ndesignated ballast tanks were also part full. \\\\n \\\\nDuring the passage from Taharoa to Tasman Bay, the iron sand cargo shifted resulting \\\\nin the ship listing to 22 degrees.  The exact mechanism of this shift is not known but it \\\\nappears to have happened in several stages.  Cargo shifted in all the holds to some \\\\ndegree.  Eventually the ship reached a safe anchorage. \\\\n \\\\nAt the request of the Transport Accident Investigation Commission (TAIC), BMT \\\\nSeaTech Ltd has undertaken a sloshing analysis to assess the behaviour of the free \\\\nwater in the cargo holds and No.6 ballast hold, and a stability assessment to investigate \\\\nthe effect of the cargo shift and free water on the safety of the vessel. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nObjective \\\\nThe aims of the sloshing analysis are to consider the free water in Nos. 1,3,5,7 and 9 \\\\ncargo carrying holds and the No.6 ballast hold in order to: \\\\n \\\\n\\u2022 Determine the forces on the internal structure \\\\n\\u2022 Identify whether design criteria were exceeded \\\\n\\u2022 Comment on the possible outcome to the ship on the day of the incident when \\\\nthe ship was on passage from Taharoa to Tasman Bay. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nThe objective of the stability assessment is to analyse the stability of the vessel \\\\naccounting for the effects of free water and the cargo shift, and to comment on the \\\\noverall safety of the vessel with respect to stability. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\n&lt;&lt; Page 102 &gt;&gt;\\\\n  \\\\n \\\\nVessel Details \\\\nThe \\\"Taharoa Express\\\" is a 9 hold Bulk Carrier of 137,900 tonne deadweight.  Originally \\\\nnamed \\\"Stellar Cape, she was built in 1990 by Hyundai Heavy Industries.  Her Class \\\\napproval by Nippon Kaiji Kyokai [Class NK] listed her with the following notation: \\\\n \\\\nNK, NS*, Bulk Carrier, \\\"Strengthened For Heavy Cargoes, \\\\nHold No. 2, 4, 6 and 8 may be empty\\\" and MNS*, MO. \\\\n \\\\nHer principal dimensions are summarised in Table 1. \\\\n \\\\nLength, BP 259.00 m \\\\nLength, scantling 259.20 m \\\\nBreadth, moulded 43.00 m \\\\nDepth, moulded 23.80 m \\\\nDraught, moulded (design) 16.60 m \\\\nDraught, moulded (scantling) 17.40 m  \\\\n \\\\nTable 1: Ship Main Particulars \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nThe ship was converted in 1999 to carry iron sand that is loaded as slurry and \\\\ndischarged conventionally.  Each hold is loaded in  two or more stages.  Once the slurry \\\\nis in the hold, the iron sand settles quickly out of the slurry and water remains above the \\\\nsand.  This supernatant water is drained thr ough an overflow channel or valves into an \\\\noverflow recess from where it is discharged overboard using the ship's overflow pumps. \\\\n \\\\nIn the normal course of events the free water above the sand is removed before the ship \\\\nsails, while further dehydration takes plac e on passage to the discharge port to reduce \\\\nthe water content to around 3%. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n\\\\n&lt;&lt; Page 103 &gt;&gt;\\\\n \\\\nReport No. C14015.7R (Final Report) 3BMT SeaTech Ltd \\u00a9 2008 \\\\n \\\\nLoading Condition \\\\nThe loading condition taken for this assessment is summarised below: \\\\n \\\\nCondition No. 26 (From Loading Calculation Program) \\\\nDraught = 12.49 m Midships \\\\nDisplacement = 113,949 tonnes \\\\n \\\\nTotal Ballast = 20,653 tonnes \\\\nNo.6 Ballast Hold 11,469 tonnes (60% full) \\\\n \\\\nTotal Cargo Mass (Iron Sand &amp; Water) = 72,624 tonnes \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nCargo \\\\nHold \\\\nTotal Cargo Mass \\\\n(Loading Computer) \\\\nIron Sand \\\\n(dry) \\\\nEstimated Free \\\\nWater \\\\n [tonnes] [tonnes] [tonnes] \\\\n1 10,554 8,394 1,148 \\\\n3 17,474 11,453 4,042 \\\\n5 13,813 5,889 6,915 \\\\n7 16,422 12,098 3,930 \\\\n9 14,361 9,069 2,614 \\\\n \\\\nTable 2: Cargo Hold Contents \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n\\\\n&lt;&lt; Page 104 &gt;&gt;\\\\n  \\\\nSloshing Assessment \\\\nThe forces on the internal structure due to fluid sloshing are governed by many different \\\\nfactors, including: \\\\n \\\\n\\u2022 The shape and position of the hold/tank \\\\n\\u2022 The dimensions of the hold \\\\n\\u2022 The fluid fill level \\\\n\\u2022 The natural frequency of wave motion of the fluid \\\\n\\u2022 The frequency and amplitude of the ship's motions \\\\n \\\\nThe sloshing phenomenon can generate considerable impact pressures on hold walls \\\\nand ceilings when the excitation is near the natural frequency of the fluid.  Consequently \\\\nthe following approach was used in the assessment: \\\\n \\\\nApproach \\\\n1. The motion characteristics of the vessel in regular sea conditions were \\\\ndetermined for a range of relative wave headings and frequencies at the \\\\npassage speed. \\\\n2. The motion characteristics of the vessel were then used to determine the range \\\\nof the ship's motions (e.g. roll, pitch, heave etc) for the sea conditions at the \\\\ntime of the incident. \\\\n3. Analytical formulae were used to estima te the natural frequency of the fluid in \\\\nNumber 1,3,5,7 and 9 cargo carrying holds and the Number 6 ballast hold for \\\\nthe specified cargo and fluid fill levels. \\\\n4. The natural frequency of wave motion of the fluid was compared with the \\\\nfrequencies and amplitudes of the vessel motions to evaluate the risk of \\\\nresonance (and hence possible high impact pressures). \\\\n5. For the higher risk cases identified, a sloshing analysis was undertaken to \\\\ncalculate the maximum sloshing pressures on the hold/tank structure. \\\\n6. The calculated sloshing pressures were compared to the Class design criteria to \\\\nidentify any areas that are exceeded and comment made on the possible \\\\noutcome to the vessel's structure. \\\\n\\\\n&lt;&lt; Page 105 &gt;&gt;\\\\n \\\\nReport No. C14015.7R (Final Report) 5BMT SeaTech Ltd \\u00a9 2008 \\\\n \\\\nShip Motions \\\\nShip Motion Characteristics \\\\nIn order to establish the sloshing characteristics of the cargo in the holds, it is necessary \\\\nto calculate the hydrodynamic characteristics (known as the Response Amplitude \\\\nOperators, RAOs) for the \\\"Taharoa Express\\\".  The linear 3D diffraction software \\\\nPRECAL was used to calculate the 6 degree of freedom motion RAOs and acceleration \\\\nRAOs at specific locations within the holds for the loading condition prior to the cargo \\\\nshifting. \\\\n \\\\nShip Motion Model \\\\nPRECAL uses the panel method to discretise the hull form into panels (shown in Figure \\\\n1).  The program calculates the velocity potentials, source strengths and flow velocities \\\\nof the hydrodynamic mesh.  Utilising potentia l flow theory the hydrodynamic forces are \\\\ncalculated in three dimensions which takes into account of forward speed. \\\\n \\\\nRoll motion is very sensitive to the level of viscous damping (which is a summation of \\\\nbilge keel and hull turbulent effects), but this is not calculated automatically by the \\\\nprogram.  A damping factor of 0.1 was used in the analysis: this gives a reasonable roll \\\\nperiod and amplitude close to the observed moti on.  It is recognised that the damping \\\\nfactor is difficult to quantify precisely but the value used is indicative of this hull and bilge \\\\nform. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nFigure 1: Hydrodynamic Mesh of Hull Form \\\\n \\\\n\\\\n&lt;&lt; Page 106 &gt;&gt;\\\\n  \\\\n \\\\nSea Conditions \\\\nWeather forecasts for New Zealand coastal wa ters [1] and wave buoy measurements at \\\\nTaharoa [2] were provided by TAIC.

The measurements made at Taharoa show \\\\ngood correlation with the forecasts (see Figure 2) and are used to estimate periods of \\\\nencounter and wave directions.

The \\\\nsloshing response depends on: \\\\n\\u2022 the properties of the fluid (density, viscosity) \\\\n\\u2022 the shape of the hold \\\\n\\u2022 the magnitude and frequency of the excitation force \\\\n\\u2022 the previous sloshing flow \\\\nIn a clean hold containing a liquid with small kinematic viscosity, the proximity of the \\\\nexcitation frequency to the resonant frequency is the main factor determining the \\\\nsloshing severity. \\\\n \\\\nThe cargo holds contain iron sand slurry and water.  It is assumed that the iron sand \\\\nremains at the bottom of the hold and does not influence the sloshing behaviour.  The \\\\niron sand negates the effect of the lower hopper tank on the resonant sloshing \\\\nfrequency.  Therefore, both the transverse and longitudinal cross sections of the hold \\\\ncan be treated as rectangular. \\\\n \\\\nThe natural sloshing period of a rectangular container is given as \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nWith \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nwhere a is the length of the sloshing container (hold length for longitudinal sloshing, hold \\\\nbreadth for transversal sloshing), g gravity, h filling level and m=1,2,3,... .  The first \\\\nsloshing mode (m=1) is the most critical with approximately 90% of the effective sloshing \\\\n \\\\n6(a) Longitudinal Cross Section 6( b) Transverse Cross Section \\\\nFigure 6: Cross-Sections of Cargo Holds (all dimensions in m) \\\\n\\\\n&lt;&lt; Page 110 &gt;&gt;\\\\n  \\\\nmass [3].  As a precaution, the second resonance condition is sometimes assessed in \\\\nvessels where sloshing is a principal design criterion. \\\\n \\\\nThe resonant period and the type of sloshing response depend on the ratio of filling \\\\nheight to hold length.  When this filling ratio is above 0.3-0.4, the sloshing fluid behaves \\\\nas a standing wave and the critical hold motions are angular (i.e. roll and pitch).  In this \\\\ncase, the fluid impacts usually occur at the top of the hold [4].  When the filling ratio is \\\\nbelow 0.3-0.4, a travelling wave (sometimes referred to as a hydraulic jump or bore) \\\\ndevelops.  This travelling wave is most severe at filling ratios of 0.1-0.3, and impact \\\\npressures can be several magnitudes greater than the static pressure.  Sloshing at low \\\\nfilling levels is more susceptible to linear hold motions such as sway and surge.  No.5 \\\\ncargo hold and No.6 ballast hold are in this critical region (see Table 3). \\\\n \\\\nThe first and second resonant sloshing periods for each hold are given in Table 3.  The \\\\nfirst resonant periods in the transverse direction range between 8.6 s and 21 s.  In the \\\\nlongitudinal direction, the range is between 5.7 s and 11.9 s.  These sloshing resonance \\\\nperiods are within the region of swell periods observed during the voyage on 21-22 June. \\\\n \\\\nCargo \\\\nHold \\\\nFree \\\\nWater \\\\nHeight h/L \\\\nSloshing Resonant Period \\\\nLongitudinal Transverse \\\\n1st Mode 2 nd Mode 1 st Mode 2 nd Mode \\\\n[m] [s] [s] [s] [s] \\\\n1 1.6 0.04 11.9 8.4 21.5 15.2 \\\\n3 4.5 0.11 7.4</td>\\n      <td>TAIC_m_2007_207</td>\\n      <td>2007</td>\\n      <td>2</td>\\n      <td>TAIC</td>\\n      <td>Capsizing/listing</td>\\n      <td>MO-2007-207</td>\\n      <td>https://www.taic.org.nz/inquiry/MO-2007-207</td>\\n      <td>report_section</td>\\n      <td>0.904613</td>\\n    </tr>\\n    <tr>\\n      <td>TAIC_5.2</td>\\n      <td>5.2 Seafarers should, where possible, avoid climbing over unguarded moving machinery or \\\\nropes and riggings under tension.</td>\\n      <td>TAIC_m_2022_207</td>\\n      <td>2022</td>\\n      <td>2</td>\\n      <td>TAIC</td>\\n      <td>Serious injury</td>\\n      <td>MO-2022-207</td>\\n      <td>https://www.taic.org.nz/inquiry/MO-2022-207</td>\\n      <td>report_section</td>\\n      <td>0.904620</td>\\n    </tr>\\n    <tr>\\n      <td>TAIC_5.2</td>\\n      <td>5.2.

If there is any doubt, such risk must be considered to exist. \\\\n\\\\n&lt;&lt; Page 29 &gt;&gt;\\\\n \\\\n  Report 08-202, Page 29 \\\\n(2) Proper use must be made of radar equipment, if fitted and operational, including long-range scanning \\\\nto obtain early warning of the risk of collision and radar plotting or equivalent systematic observation \\\\nof detected objects. \\\\n(3) Assumptions must not be made on the basis of scanty information, especially scanty radar \\\\ninformation. \\\\n(4) In determining if the risk of collision exists, the following considerations must be among those taken \\\\ninto account - \\\\n(a) such risk must be considered to exist if the compass bearing of an approaching vessel does not \\\\nappreciably change; and \\\\n(b) such risk may sometimes exist even when an appreciable bearing change is evident, particularly \\\\nwhen approaching a very large vessel or a tow or when approaching a vessel at close range. \\\\n \\\\n22.8 Action to avoid collision \\\\n(1) Any action to avoid collision must, if the circumstances of the case allow, be positive, made in ample \\\\ntime and with due regard to the observance of good seafaring practice. \\\\n(2) Any alteration of course or speed or both to avoid collision must, if the circumstances of the case \\\\nallow, be large enough to be readily apparent to another vessel observing visually or by radar. A \\\\nsuccession of small alterations of course or speed or both should be avoided. \\\\n(3) If there is sufficient sea-room, alteration of course alone may be the most effective action to avoid a \\\\nclose-quarters situation provided that - \\\\n(a) it is made in good time; \\\\n(b) it is substantial; and \\\\n(c) it does not result in another close-quarters situation. \\\\n(4) Action taken to avoid collision with another vessel must be such as to result in passing at a safe \\\\ndistance. The effectiveness of the action must be carefully checked until the other vessel is finally past \\\\nand clear. \\\\n(5) If necessary, to avoid collision or to allow more time to assess the situation, a vessel must slacken its \\\\nspeed or take all way off by stopping or reversing its means of propulsion. \\\\n(6) (a) A vessel that, by any rules in this Part, is obliged not to impede the passage or safe passage of \\\\nanother vessel must, when required, take early action to allow sufficient sea-room for the safe \\\\npassage of the other vessel. \\\\n(b) A vessel that is required not to impede the passage or safe passage of another vessel is not relieved \\\\nof this obligation if approaching the other vessel so as to involve risk of collision. It must, when \\\\ntaking action, have full regard to the action which may be required of itself and the other vessel by \\\\nthis section of Part 22. \\\\n(c) A vessel the passage of which is not to be impeded remains fully obliged to comply with this \\\\nsection of Part 22 when the two vessels are approaching one another so as to involve risk of \\\\ncollision. \\\\n \\\\nSUBSECTION 3 - CONDUCT OF VESSELS IN RESTRICTED VISIBILITY \\\\n22.19 Conduct of vessels in restricted visibility \\\\n(1) This subsection applies to vessels not in sight of one another when navigating in or near an area of \\\\nrestricted visibility. \\\\n(2) Every vessel must proceed at a safe speed adapted to the prevailing circumstances and conditions of \\\\nrestricted visibility. \\\\n(3) A power-driven vessel must have its engines ready for immediate manoeuvre. \\\\n\\\\n&lt;&lt; Page 30 &gt;&gt;\\\\n \\\\nReport 08-202, Page 30    \\\\n(4) Every vessel must have due regard to the prevailing circumstances and conditions of restricted \\\\nvisibility when complying with subsection 1 of this section. \\\\n(5) (a) A vessel which detects by radar alone the presence of another vessel must determine whether a \\\\nclose-quarters situation is developing and must determine if risk of collision exists. If so, it must \\\\ntake avoiding action in ample time. \\\\n(b) If such action consists of an alteration of course, the following must, as far as possible, be \\\\navoided: \\\\n(i) an alteration of course to port for a vessel forward of the beam, other than for a vessel being \\\\novertaken; and  \\\\n(ii) an alteration of course towards a vessel abeam or abaft the beam. \\\\n(6) Except where it has been determined that there is no risk of collision, every vessel that hears the fog \\\\nsignal of another vessel apparently forward of its beam, or cannot avoid a close-quarters situation with \\\\nanother vessel forward of its beam, must - \\\\n(a) reduce its speed to the minimum at which it can be kept on its course; and \\\\n(b) if necessary, take all way off; and \\\\n(c) in any event navigate with extreme caution until the danger of collision is over. \\\\nSection 3 - Sound and light signals \\\\n22.32 Definitions relating to this Section \\\\nIn this section - \\\\n\\\"Prolonged blast\\\" means a blast of from four to six seconds duration: \\\\n\\\"Short blast\\\" means a blast of about one second's duration: \\\\n\\\"Whistle\\\" means any sound signalling appliance capable of producing the prescribed blasts and \\\\nwhich complies with the specifications in Appendix 3 to this rule. \\\\n22.33 Equipment for sound signals \\\\n(1) A vessel of 12 metres or more in length must be provided with - \\\\n(a) a whistle; and \\\\n(b) a bell; and \\\\n(c) in the case of a vessel of 100 metres or more in length, a gong. \\\\n(2) The tone and sound of the gong must not be able to be confused with that of the bell. \\\\n(3) The whistle, bell, and gong must comply with the specifications in Appendix 3 to this rule. \\\\n(4) As long as they can still be sounded manually, the bell or gong or both may be replaced by other \\\\nequipment having the same respective sound characteristics. \\\\n(5) A vessel of less than 12 metres in length is not obliged to carry the sound signalling appliances \\\\nprescribed, but if it does not carry the prescribed sound signalling appliances, it must be provided with \\\\nsome other means of making an efficient sound signal. \\\\n \\\\n22.34 Manoeuvring and warning signals \\\\n(1) When vessels are in sight of one another, a power-driven vessel underway, manoeuvring as authorised \\\\nor required by this Part, must indicate that manoeuvre by the following signals on its whistle - \\\\n(a) one short blast to mean \\\"I am altering my course to starboard\\\": \\\\n(b) two short blasts to mean \\\"I am altering my course to port\\\": \\\\n(c) three short blasts to mean \\\"I am operating astern propulsion\\\". \\\\n\\\\n&lt;&lt; Page 31 &gt;&gt;\\\\n \\\\n  Report 08-202, Page 31 \\\\n(2) Any vessel may supplement the whistle signals prescribed in rule 22.34(1) with the following light \\\\nsignals, repeated as appropriate, whilst the manoeuvre is being carried out - \\\\n(a) one flash to mean \\\"I am altering my course to starboard\\\": \\\\n(b) two flashes to mean \\\" I am altering my course to port\\\": \\\\n(c) three flashes to mean \\\"I am operating astern propulsion\\\". \\\\nThe duration of each flash must be about one second, the interval between successive flashes must be \\\\nabout one second, and the interval between successive signals must not be less than 10 seconds. \\\\nThe light used for this signal must, if fitted, be an all-round white light. It must be visible for a minimum \\\\ndistance of 5 miles and comply with the provisions of Appendix 1.12 of this Part. \\\\n(3) When in sight of one another in a narrow channel or fairway - \\\\n(a) a vessel intending to overtake another must indicate its intention in compliance with rule 22.9 \\\\n(narrow channels) by sounding one of the following sound signals on its whistle: \\\\ntwo prolonged blasts followed by one short blast to mean \\\"I intend to overtake you on your starboard \\\\nside\\\"; or \\\\ntwo prolonged blasts followed by two short blasts to mean \\\"I intend to overtake you on your port \\\\nside\\\"; \\\\n(b) the vessel about to be overtaken when acting in compliance with rule 22.9 (narrow channels) must \\\\nindicate its agreement by sounding the following signal on its whistle: \\\\none prolonged, one short, one prolonged and one short blast, in that order. \\\\n(4) When vessels in sight of one another are approaching each other and for any reason either fails to \\\\nunderstand the intentions or actions of the other, OR is in any doubt whether sufficient action is being \\\\ntaken by the other to avoid collision, the vessel in doubt must immediately indicate such doubt by \\\\nsounding the following signal on its whistle - \\\\nat least five short and rapid blasts. \\\\nThis signal may be supplemented by a light signal of at least 5 short and rapid flashes. \\\\n(5) A vessel nearing a bend or an area of a channel or fairway where other vessels may be obscured by an \\\\nintervening obstruction must sound one prolonged blast. \\\\nSuch signal must be answered with a prolonged blast by any approaching vessel that may be within \\\\nhearing around the bend or behind the intervening obstruction. \\\\n(6) If whistles are fitted on a vessel at a distance apart of more than 100 metres, one whistle only must be \\\\nused for giving manoeuvring and warning signals. \\\\n \\\\n22.35 Sound signals in restricted visibility \\\\nIn or near an area of restricted visibility, by day and by night, the following signals must be used:  \\\\n(a) subject to rule 22.35(b) - \\\\n(i) a power-driven vessel making way through the water must sound one prolonged blast at intervals \\\\nof not more than 2 minutes; \\\\n(ii) a power-driven vessel underway but stopped and making no way through the water must sound \\\\ntwo prolonged blasts in succession with 2 seconds between them at intervals of not more than 2 \\\\nminutes: \\\\n(b) the following vessels - \\\\n(i) vessels not under command, vessels restricted in their ability to manoeuvre, vessels constrained by \\\\ntheir draught, sailing vessels, vessels engaged in fishing, vessels engaged in towing or pushing \\\\nanother vessel; and  \\\\n\\\\n&lt;&lt; Page 32 &gt;&gt;\\\\n \\\\nReport 08-202, Page 32    \\\\n(ii) vessels engaged in fishing at anchor and vessels restricted in their ability to manoeuvre when \\\\ncarrying out work at anchor; must sound three blasts in succession, namely one prolonged followed \\\\nby two short blasts, at intervals of not more that 2 minutes: \\\\n(c) if crewed, a vessel towed or, if more that one vessel is towed, the last vessel of the tow, must sound \\\\nfour blasts in succession, namely one prolonged followed by three short blasts: \\\\nThis signal must be made at intervals of not more than 2 minutes, and where practicable, be made \\\\nimmediately after the signal made by the towing vessel. \\\\n(d) When a pushing vessel and a vessel being pushed ahead are rigidly connected in a composite unit, \\\\nthey are to be regarded as a power-driven vessel and sound the appropriate sound signal as described \\\\nin rule 22.35(a): \\\\n(e) A vessel at anchor must ring a bell rapidly for about 5 seconds at intervals of not more than 1 minute \\\\nand - \\\\n(i) if the vessel is 100 metres or more in length, the bell must be sounded in the forepart of the vessel; \\\\nand \\\\n(ii) immediately after the ringing of the bell the gong must be sounded rapidly for about five seconds \\\\nat the after part of the vessel. \\\\nA vessel at anchor may additionally sound three blasts in succession, namely one short, one prolonged, \\\\nand one short blast to give warning of its position: \\\\n(f) a vessel aground must give the bell signal, and (if required) the gong signal, prescribed for a vessel at \\\\nanchor in rule 22.35(e), \\\\nAND in addition must give three separate and distinct strokes on the bell immediately before and after the \\\\nrapid ringing of the bell. \\\\nA vessel aground may also sound an appropriate whistle signal:  \\\\n(g) a vessel less than 12 metres in length is not obliged to give the above mentioned signals, but, if it does \\\\nnot, must make some other efficient sound signal at intervals of not more than 2 minutes. \\\\n(h) when engaged on pilotage duty, a pilot vessel may in addition to the signals prescribed for power-\\\\ndriven vessels (rule 22.35(a)) or vessels at anchor (rule 22.35(e)), sound an identity signal consisting \\\\nof four short blasts. \\\\n\\\\n&lt;&lt;

The course being developed will be such that it can be presented to not \\\\nonly the fishing industry, but also to masters of non-passenger and passenger \\\\nvessels. \\\\nMNZ is proposing to utilise a course developed by SNMAE (Society of Naval \\\\nArchitects and marine Engineers) called Fishing Vessel Stability Training \\\\nCourse.  The course teaches, over the space of 1-2 hours, the basics of stability, \\\\nfrom which many scenarios can be discussed. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nApproved on 20 March 2008 for publication Hon W P Jeffries \\\\n Chief Commissioner \\\\n\\\\n&lt;&lt; Page 27 &gt;&gt;\\\\n \\\\nReport 07-206, Page 27 \\\\nAppendix 1 \\\\nThe transverse stability of a vessel determines, among other things, its roll period.  A ship with a high \\\\ntransverse stability is said to be \\\"stiff\\\" and has a short, quick roll period, whereas a ship with a low \\\\ntransverse stability is said to be \\\"tender\\\" and has a longer, slow roll period.  Decreasing the stability too \\\\nfar would make a ship unstable and unsafe.   \\\\nThe figure below illustrates a basic explanation of stability and the terms and definitions associated with \\\\nit, showing a ship's hull at an angle of heel to the waterline WL of \\u03b8 (theta) degrees.   \\\\nWhen the hull is immersed in water, the buoyant force from the water pressure acts through a point B, the \\\\ncentre of buoyancy.  This force is equal and opposite to the displacement \\u2206 of the vessel which acts \\\\ndownward through the centre of gravity G. \\\\nB is initially on the centreplane, but when the vessel is rolled to an angle \\u03b8, the change in immersed \\\\nunderwater shape causes it to move to a point B1.  At this angle the lines of action of the forces of \\\\nbuoyancy and displacement are separated by the horizontal distance from G to Z.   \\\\nThe distance GZ is the righting lever, and is an important indication of a ship's stability at angles of heel \\\\nover about 10\\u00b0.  Large values of GZ mean that the forces have a longer lever arm and the ship will return \\\\nto the upright position more rapidly.  Negative values of GZ mean that the ship will capsize.   \\\\nAt the intersection of the vertical line through B1 and the centreplane of the vessel is the metacentre M.  \\\\nThe height of M above G is the metacentric height GM and is a useful measure of stability at angles of \\\\nheel up to around 10\\u00b0.  Large values imply that a vessel is stiff, small values imply that it is tender and \\\\nnegative values imply that it is unstable.  GZ is related to GM by the equation: GZ = GM(sin \\u03b8). \\\\nPoint K is a reference point on the keel of the ship.  Point N is a point level with K on the vertical line \\\\nthrough B1.  The distance KN is used for analytical purposes and is represented in KN tables.   \\\\nFigure 11 \\\\nBasic stability diagram \\\\nWL \\\\nG Z \\\\nM \\\\nB1 B \\\\nK N \\\\n\\u2206 \\\\n\\u2206 \\\\n\\u03b8 \\\\n\\\\n&lt;&lt; Page 28 &gt;&gt;\\\\n \\\\nReport 07-206, Page 28 \\\\nA simplified method of determining a vessel's stability when carrying cargo was to use a limiting KG \\\\ncurve graph.  This graph plotted the displacement of the vessel and cargo against the homogenous KG \\\\n(the distance K and G of the vessel and cargo combined) and showed a curve of recommended maximum \\\\nKG against displacement.   \\\\nAs cargo was loaded on the deck, in this case, of the barge, the homogenous centre of gravity G would \\\\nrise and thus the KG would increase.  As the cargo was loaded the vessel would sink in the water to a \\\\ndraught that reflects the combined weight of the vessel and cargo and thus B would rise and the KB \\\\nwould increase although not by as much as the increase in KG.  As the KG increased the GZ would \\\\ndecrease.   \\\\nA factor that co",
         "uld adversely affect the stability of a vessel was free surface.  As a ship floods there was a \\\\nloss of stability due to free surface effect as the flooding water accumulated within the hull in tanks and \\\\nspaces and these spaces became partially filled.  As the vessel inclined the surface of the liquid stayed \\\\nlevel, this resulted in a displacement of the centre of gravity of the tank or space. The effect is similar to \\\\nthat of carrying a large flat tray of water. When an edge is tipped, the water rushes to that side which \\\\nexacerbates the tip even further and can cause a vessel to capsize.   \\\\n \\\\n\\\\n&lt;&lt; Page 29 &gt;&gt;\\\\n \\\\n \\\\nAppendix 2 \\\\n1957 \\\\nBarge constructed \\\\nat Mercer \\\\n1994 \\\\nMaritime \\\\nTransport Act \\\\ncomes into \\\\nforce \\\\n1995 \\\\nBarge bought \\\\nby Winstone \\\\nand rebuilt at \\\\nMere Mere \\\\n20/09/1996 \\\\nBarge issued with \\\\nsubmersion line \\\\ncertificate, \\\\nextended river \\\\nlimits, freeboard \\\\n240mm valid \\\\n20/09/2001\\\\n25/09/1996 \\\\nBarge \\\\nissued with \\\\ncompletion \\\\ncertificate \\\\nby M&amp;I \\\\nNov 1997 \\\\nBarge towed \\\\nto Kaipara \\\\nHarbour \\\\n01/02/1998 \\\\nMaritime Rule \\\\nParts 46 and \\\\ncome into force \\\\n01/02/2001 \\\\nMaritime Rule \\\\nPart 40C comes \\\\ninto force \\\\n10/04/2001 \\\\nAgreement to \\\\nsupply SSM \\\\nservices from \\\\nNortel \\\\n12/04/2001 \\\\nNortel request \\\\nMaritime NZ to \\\\nadvise number for \\\\nbarge \\\\n17/04/2001 \\\\nNortel issues SSM \\\\ncertificate valid \\\\nuntil 17/04/2005 \\\\n17/04/2001 \\\\nNortel issues fit-for-\\\\npurpose certificate, \\\\nKaipara Harbour 2 \\\\npersons on board \\\\n20/09/2001 \\\\nSubmersion line \\\\ncertificate expires \\\\n24/09/2001 \\\\nCompletion certificate \\\\nexpires \\\\n07/11/2002 \\\\nNortel carries out \\\\naudit \\\\n07/01/2003 \\\\nNortel carries out \\\\naudit \\\\n12/12/2003 \\\\nMaritime NZ \\\\nadvise Nortel of a \\\\nnew owner - \\\\nprobably new \\\\nskipper \\\\n04/02/2004 \\\\nNortel carries out \\\\naudit \\\\n04/02/2004 \\\\nNortel completes \\\\nSSM profile \\\\n17/04/2005 \\\\nNortel issues SSM \\\\ncertificate valid \\\\nuntil 17/04/2009\\\\n06/05/2005 \\\\nNortel completes \\\\nout SSM profile \\\\n20/06/2005 \\\\nNortel advises \\\\nWinstone by \\\\nletter that a load \\\\nline certificate is \\\\nrequired \\\\n19/10/2006 \\\\nNortel issues \\\\ninspection and \\\\nload line \\\\ncalculation \\\\ninvoice \\\\n16/11/2006 \\\\nNortel request \\\\nMaritime NZ to \\\\nissue load line \\\\ncertificate.

Each review, by \\\\nindependent bodies external to MNZ, found that the philosophy behind the \\\\nsystem was sound, and since the system was introduced safety statistics in all \\\\ncommercial maritime sectors have improved.  While feedback from the \\\\nindustry indicates solid support for the intent of the system MNZ considers \\\\nthat there is still room for improvement in how the system is implemented \\\\nand delivered by MNZ and SSM companies.  \\\\nIn line with our continuous improvement policy, a review of the SSM system \\\\nhas been identified as the key strategic priority for MNZ in its  \\\\n2007-2010 Statement of Intent.  MNZ has commenced a programme of work \\\\nto enhance the sustainability and effectiveness of the SSM system by: \\\\n1. Ensuring that the regulatory framework supporting SSM is robust and \\\\nappropriate by reviewing the maritime rules that govern its operation.

Complementing existing guidance material (Health and Safety: A Guide; \\\\nFishSAFE Health and Safety Guidelines; various leaflets) with additional \\\\nmaterial including a comprehensive resource to support owners in the \\\\ndevelopment of their SSM systems, specific fatigue management \\\\nmaterial, and health and safety guidelines for passenger and non-\\\\npassenger operations.  This additional material is being progressively \\\\nreleased through until December 2007 in association with targeted \\\\ntraining material; \\\\n3. Increasing the amount and quality of formal and informal training and \\\\neducation that is available to all those working in the system, including \\\\nMNZ and SSM Company staff, surveyors, owners and operators.  This \\\\ntraining will be supported by the development of a mentor network \\\\nutilising experienced industry participants to provide support and advice \\\\nto their peers;  \\\\n4. Reviewing the current capacity and quality of service delivery by both \\\\nMNZ and SSM Companies in the area of SSM and comparing this with \\\\nrequirements in order to identify and address necessary areas for \\\\nimprovement; \\\\n5. Allocating additional resources to the SSM team within MNZ to allow for \\\\nmore responsive contact with industry and other stakeholders, along with \\\\nthe provision of personalised assistance where required to owners and \\\\noperators; and \\\\n6. Structured auditing by MNZ of SSM service providers. \\\\nThis work is being actively progressed and monitored within MNZ.

Wave conditions at the time were observed by the master and the signal station operator and were considered to be just within the maximum permissible parameters for the crossing. However, the available information from wave forecasts and data from the Taharoa wave-rider buoy suggested that there was a high risk of waves exceeding these parameters during the estimated 30-minute crossing time.\\n\\n- **Findings and Analysis*",
         "*: Despite being within permissible wave conditions as observed, the calculated risks from available data indicated a significant threat of encountering severe conditions while making the crossing. This was significant because it showed that relying solely on visual observations without considering forecast data could lead to underestimation of potential hazards.\\n\\n- **Implications**: The incident underscored the importance of not only relying on real-time observations but also taking into account forecasts and available buoy data to assess risks accurately before undertaking maritime navigation in potentially hazardous areas like bar crossings.\\n\\n- **Report ID**: TAIC_m_2010_206\\n\\nThis situation serves as a critical reminder of the need for comprehensive risk assessment practices involving real-time data, forecast information, and historical data to ensure safety during bar crossings and other high-risk maritime operations.\", \"options\": null}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": null}, \"content\": \"What actually happened to the spirit of resolution?\", \"options\": null}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"\\ud83d\\udd0d Searching database for more information\"}, \"content\": \"Using these parameters to search the database: {\\\"query\\\":\\\"Spirit of Resolution Manukau Bar incident\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"fts\\\",\\\"year_range\\\":[2005,2023],\\\"document_type\\\":[\\\"report_section\\\"],\\\"modes\\\":[2],\\\"agencies\\\":[\\\"TAIC\\\"]}\", \"options\": null}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"metadata\": {\"title\": \"\\ud83d\\udcd6 Reading 100 results\"}, \"content\": \"<table border=\\\"1\\\" class=\\\"dataframe\\\">\\n  <thead>\\n    <tr style=\\\"text-align: right;\\\">\\n      <th>document_id</th>\\n      <th>document</th>\\n      <th>report_id</th>\\n      <th>year</th>\\n      <th>mode</th>\\n      <th>agency</th>\\n      <th>type</th>\\n      <th>agency_id</th>\\n      <th>url</th>\\n      <th>document_type</th>\\n      <th>_score</th>\\n    </tr>\\n  </thead>\\n  <tbody>\\n    <tr>\\n      <td>TAIC_2.8</td>\\n      <td>2.8.

This departure was timed to coincide with high tide, offering optimal conditions for bar crossing. \\n\\n- **Encounter with the Manukau Bar**: As the vessel approached the Manukau Bar, the conditions initially appeared marginally acceptable but were at the limits of what was considered safe. Wave conditions looked permissible to the master and bridge team, and they made the decision to proceed with the crossing at approximately 07:39.\\n\\n- **The Incident**: For the first 20 minutes across the bar, the passage was relatively uneventful until the ship encountered a series of large waves. These unexpected large wave patterns quickly increased in size, resulting in the ship's speed dropping to almost zero. The ship was ultimately carried sideways by strong tidal and current flows out of the main channel and into shallower waters.\\n\\n- **Damage and Consequences**: During this orde, the bottom three meters and the trailing flap of the vessel's rudder struck the seabed and were lost. The ship sustained wave-induced damages on its bow and several deck containers. \\n\\n- **Ground",
         "ing**: Eventually, the Spirit of Resolution grounded on the Manukau Bar when overwhelmed by these wave conditions and was effectively immobilized until a subsequent towing operation could be initiated.\\n\\n- **Post-Incident Actions**: The ship remained offshore for about two days before being safely towed by available vessels.\\n\\nFor further information, you can review the **[TAIC report](https://www.taic.org.nz/inquiry/MO-2010-206)** on this incident using the Report ID: TAIC_m_2010_206.\", \"options\": null}]",

The 2 flights were routine scheduled flights between Auckland and Sydney.  Other \\\\nthan the reported observation by the passenger after landing at Sydney, th e crew were \\\\nnot aware of anything unusual during the flights.  \\\\n \\\\n2.  The couple were diligent in firstly observing the unusual state of the wing and then in \\\\nreporting their concerns to the crew of the aircraft.

The lifting of the panels was probably due to the detached section of the flap control \\\\ntrack not aligning correctly in po sition.  The detached section was instead forced up \\\\ninto the top of the wing when the flaps were retracted after departing from Auckland.  \\\\nThe passenger probably believed that the panel in front of the outboard end of the flap, \\\\nand where he saw the protrus ion, was a continuation of the aircraft's spoiler system.  \\\\nHowever, the outboard end of the flap extended some 2 m past the last spoiler panel.  \\\\nThis confusion was understandable considering the distance from the fuselage to the \\\\noutboard end of the flap an d the passenger not being familiar with the aircraft type.  \\\\n \\\\n4.  During normal operation, rollers attached to the ends of each flap would run along \\\\nboth sides of a fillet on the flap control tracks.  The flap control tracks ensured the \\\\nflaps were at the corr ect angles as they were extended or retracted.  On ZK - NCH, the \\\\nrollers on the end of the flap probably restrained the detached section of flap control \\\\ntrack when it initially failed.  As the final increments of flap were selected on \\\\napproach to Sydney, the  detached section of flap control track was able to slide along \\\\nthe rollers to stick up into the airflow above the wing.  As the flaps were retracted, the \\\\nrollers pulled the section into the wing once the air loads on the flaps reduced as the \\\\naircraft slow ed.  The section was probably pulled back into about its normal position.  \\\\n \\\\n5.  The passenger accurately described events to the crew after landing.  But by using \\\\nspecific aviation terminology to describe the area where the protuberance was seen, \\\\nnamely the outboard spoiler, the passenger unwittingly concentrated attention on this \\\\narea and not the outboard end of the flap -  some 2 m past the spoilers.  \\\\n \\\\n6.  The briefing by the captain and the inspection by the engineers were thorough and \\\\ncorrect -  based on the information received.  To be able to detect the broken flap \\\\ncontrol track, the engineers would have needed to specifically look at the track.  While \\\\nthe captain could have obtained a visual confirmation from the passenger of the \\\\nspecific area concerned, th e terminology used left little doubt in the minds of the \\\\npeople concerned as to what was meant.   \\\\n \\\\n7.  The departure and return flight to Auckland proceeded normally.  The detached \\\\nsection of flap control track continued to remain restrained by the flap rol lers.  On \\\\nselecting the final increments of flap approaching Auckland the section was this time \\\\nable to come free of the rollers and fall from the aircraft.  Fortunately no injuries were \\\\nsustained when the section of flap control track struck the warehouse .  \\\\n \\\\n8.  The loss of the flap control track did not significantly affect the control or safety of the \\\\naircraft as it made its landing.  Each flap section had 2 flap - deflection control tracks to \\\\nassist in the control of the flap.  The loss of one track did no t reduce this control under \\\\nthe air loads present at the time.  \\\\n  \\\\n9.  The level of damage, both to the aircraft and the warehouse, was minimal.  However, \\\\nthe potential for damage or injury caused by an object falling from an aircraft was \\\\nsignificant.</td>\\n      <td>TAIC_a_2001_004</td>\\n      <td>2001</td>\\n      <td>0</td>\\n      <td>TAIC</td>\\n      <td>Airframe</td>\\n      <td>AO-2001-004</td>\\n      <td>https://www.taic.org.nz/inquiry/AO-2001-004</td>\\n      <td>report_section</td>\\n      <td>8.881316</td>\\n    </tr>\\n    <tr>\\n      <td>TAIC_3.7</td>\\n      <td>3.7 Neither the pilots, nor the controller, were aw are that a loss of vertical separation had occurred \\\\nuntil advised by Ohakea Control.</td>\\n      <td>TAIC_a_2002_007</td>\\n      <td>2002</td>\\n      <td>0</td>\\n      <td>TAIC</td>\\n      <td>Aircraft separation</td>\\n      <td>AO-2002-007</td>\\n      <td>https://www.taic.org.nz/inquiry/AO-2002-007</td>\\n      <td>report_section</td>\\n      <td>8.881248</td>\\n    </tr>\\n    <tr>\\n      <td>TAIC_a_2009_005_7</td>\\n      <td>The controllers not detecting an impending loss of separation.</td>\\n      <td>TAIC_a_2009_005</td>\\n      <td>2009</td>\\n      <td>0</td>\\n      <td>TAIC</td>\\n      <td>Aircraft separation</td>\\n      <td>AO-2009-005</td>\\n      <td>https://www.taic.org.nz/inquiry/AO-2009-005</td>\\n      <td>safety_issue</td>\\n      <td>8.852285</td>\\n    </tr>\\n    <tr>\\n      <td>TAIC_2.35</td>\\n      <td>2.35 The loss of pitch control and sudden descent was symptomatic of a stall.

documented several cases involving mast bumping. The reported issues primarily concern Robinson helicopters, which have shown susceptibility to mast bumping, especially during low-G maneuvers or in certain flight conditions. Here are some of the cases:\\n\\n1. **Lack of Reliable Evidence**:\\n   - The lack of reliable evidence on the initiating causes of mast bumping has limited the effectiveness of safety investigations. (Report ID: TAIC_a_2018_006)\\n   - [Report TAIC_a_2018_006](https://www.taic.org.nz/inquiry/AO-2018-006)\\n\\n2. **Pilot's Reaction to Unexpected Movements**:\\n   - A pilot's instinctive reaction to unexpected roll could lead to mast-bumping, indicating the need for improved training or restraint systems.

However, not all aircraft are fitted with radios, nor were they \\\\nrequired to be.</td>\\n      <td>TAIC_a_2019_006</td>\\n      <td>2019</td>\\n      <td>0</td>\\n      <td>TAIC</td>\\n      <td>Aircraft separation</td>\\n      <td>AO-2019-006</td>\\n      <td>https://www.taic.org.nz/inquiry/AO-2019-006</td>\\n      <td>report_section</td>\\n      <td>0.876698</td>\\n    </tr>\\n    <tr>\\n      <td>TAIC_3.2</td>\\n      <td>3.2 The aircraft movement rate and weather were favourable and did not create an onerous \\\\nworkload for the aerodrome controller.</td>\\n      <td>TAIC_a_2007_005</td>\\n      <td>2007</td>\\n      <td>0</td>\\n      <td>TAIC</td>\\n      <td>Runway events</td>\\n      <td>AO-2007-005</td>\\n      <td>https://www.taic.org.nz/inquiry/AO-2007-005</td>\\n      <td>report_section</td>\\n      <td>0.876698</td>\\n    </tr>\\n    <tr>\\n      <td>TAIC_3.2</td>\\n      <td>3.2.

Here are some key points:\\n\\n1. **Lack of Evidence**: The lack of reliable evidence on the initiating causes of mast bumping occurrences limits the effectiveness of safety investigations. [TAIC AO-2018-006](https://www.taic.org.nz/inquiry/AO-2018-006)\\n\\n2. *",
         "*Pilot Reaction and Turbulence**: A pilot's instinctive reaction to an unexpected roll or movements during severe turbulence or low-G conditions could lead to mast bumping. Enhanced training or restraint systems are recommended. [TAIC AO-2014-006](https://www.taic.org.nz/inquiry/AO-2014-006)\\n\\n3. **Flight Manuals**: At the time of certain accidents, flight manuals for Robinson helicopters did not adequately warn pilots of the hazardous operating practices and environmental conditions that lead to mast bumping. [TAIC AO-2013-003](https://www.taic.org.nz/inquiry/AO-2013-003)\\n\\n4. **Cause Determination Challenges**: The true causes of mast bumping and in-flight break-ups are often challenging to determine since the accidents are usually fatal and the remains make it hard to confirm mechanical failure as a cause.

Here are some insights from TAIC reports regarding how fatigue causes accidents:\\n\\n1. **Distraction and Loss of Situational Awareness**: In some cases, personnel experienced distractions and fatigue, leading to lapses in attention and situational awareness, increasing the risk of collisions ([TAIC Report ID: RO-2000-101](https://www.taic.org.nz/inquiry/RO-2000-101)).\\n\\n2. **Impaired Judgment and Reaction Times**: Fatigue, especially due to disruption of circadian rhythm, can impair performance, leading to slower reaction times and impaired judgment during critical operations ([TAIC Report ID: MO-2000-211](https://www.taic.org.nz/inquiry/MO-2000-211)).\\n\\n3. **Scheduled Breaks and Time-on-Task Fatigue**: In the railroad industry, the absence of systems ensuring scheduled rest breaks can lead to time-on-task fatigue, reducing vigilance and increasing the likelihood of errors ([TAIC Report ID: RO-2005-102](https://www.taic.org.nz/inquiry/RO-2005-102)).\\n\\n4. **Cumulative Sleep Debt**: Personnel experiencing cumulative sleep debt show decreased alertness and increased biological sleepiness, which can contribute to accidents such as collisions ([TAIC Report ID: RO-2000-121](https://www.taic.org.nz/inquiry/RO-2000-121)).\\n\\n5. **Irregular and Prolonged Working Hours**: These conditions lead to inadequate rest periods and poor-quality sleep, which increase the risk of errors and accidents for skippers and crew members in the marine sector ([TAIC Report ID: MO-2001-212](https://www.taic.org.nz/inquiry/MO-2001-212)).\\n\\nThese reports highlight the critical role that fatigue plays in affecting performance and decision-making across various transport modes, thereby increasing the risk of accidents.

The rule is due to be \\\\nsubmitted for the Minister of Transport\\u201fs approval later this year, and if approved will \\\\ncome in to force on 1 October 2011. \\\\nA key change under Part 82 is a requirement for operators to establish programmes \\\\nof competency assessments  to ensure the initial and ongoing competence of jet -\\\\nboat drivers.  One of the aims of the assessment requirements is to ensure that \\\\ndrivers are compet ent when transferring between different types of jet -boat and \\\\nareas of operation, as well as to manage the risk of experienced drivers becoming \\\\nover-confident.
