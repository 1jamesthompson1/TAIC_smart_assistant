This is a quick chatbot gradio app. 

It is being built seperately from the main project repo: https://github.com/1jamesthompson1/TAIC-report-summary to keep oveheads low.

It is likely following dicussions at TAIC that this chat interface is alot better for the end user. Therefore it may be implemented and merged with the current flask viewer app. The easiest way seems to be do doing this via embedding. However long term it would be better to have it all on the same framework.
