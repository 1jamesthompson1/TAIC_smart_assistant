## Project Status

As of October 2025 this app is going into organisation wide deployment. There is no public access at the moment.

The app implementation is completely seperate from the code base, new deployments can be spun up with relative ease. However it is access to the database generated by [taic-engine](https://github.com/1jamesthompson1/TAIC-report-summary). Any interest in your own deployment or a tool like this should be directed to James Thompson (1jamesthompson1@gmail.com)

### Setup for Local Development

_Note that this has only ever been 'completed' on Linux machines. For ease of use I would recommend [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) for windows users_

1. **Install dependencies**

```bash
# Install uv if you haven't already
curl -Ls https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Install project dependencies
uv sync --dev

# Setup pre-commits
uv run pre-commit install
```

2. **Get the vector database**
*This is simply so that when you want to test the webapp you can use the searcher quickly as it is locally fetching data.*

Install `azcopy` by following: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azcopy-v10?tabs=apt
Install `az cli` by following: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest

You will then need to login with `az login`.

```bash
# Download and setup the vector database
uv run python working_files/download_vector_db.py
```

3. **Environment configuration**

```bash
# Copy and configure your environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Azure credentials and API keys
```

4. **Run the app locally**

```bash
uv run uvicorn app:app --host localhost --port 7860 --reload --timeout-graceful-shutdown 1
```

5. **Access the application**
- Open your browser to `http://localhost:7860`
- For the tools interface: `http://localhost:7860/tools`

### Development Workflow

1. Create a feature branch from `main`
2. Make your changes with appropriate commit messages
3. Create a pull request with a prefix of the type of change (`major:`, `minor:`, `patch:`)
4. When merging, use squash-and-merge to keep a clean history

#### Version Management

This project uses semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):

- **Patch** versions are auto-bumped on every push to main
- **Minor/Major** versions can be manually triggered using GitHub Actions
- All conversations and searches store the app version they were created with
- Version compatibility checking prevents loading incompatible data

#### Auto-versioning Rules

PR titles should include one of the following keywords to indicate the type of version bump required:

- `major:` → Major version bump
- `minor:` → Minor version bump  
- `patch:` → Patch version bump

### CI/CD Configuration

This project uses GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment. The following secrets need to be configured in your GitHub repository:

#### Required GitHub Secrets

| Secret Name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `AZURE_STORAGE_SAS_TOKEN` | Azure storage account SAS token to allow reading of the `envs` container |
| `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME` | Azure Storage account name where test config is stored |

#### Test Environment Setup

The CI pipeline automatically downloads a test configuration file (`test.env` saved as `.env`) from Azure Blob Storage during test runs. This file should contain all necessary environment variables for testing with real services.
