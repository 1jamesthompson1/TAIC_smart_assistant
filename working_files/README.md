# Working files

This is a collection of notebook and scripts that are useful for development but want to keep from clogging up the root directory.

| name | purpose | link |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Usage logs | This can be used for either interactive investigation of the app usage logs or making a semi presentable report | [usage_logs.ipynb](usage_logs.ipynb) |
| Download vector db | This script can be run to download the latest version of the vector db from the azure storage location. Helpful for local development | [download_vector_db.py](download_vector_db.py) |
