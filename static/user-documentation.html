Below you will find a concise frequently asked questions style documentation for the smart tools platform. If you have any further questions please reach out the maintainer who's details can be found in the footer of the application.

<div class="section-box">
  <h2 id="smart-assistant">Smart Assistant</h2>
  <p>
    This is a smart assistnat that is powered by a LLM (similar model to what is present in ChatGPT) to help answer the questions you have. The AI has access to the database of documentat that it will use to help answer your questions. You can ask it anything related to the investigation reports from TAIC, ATSB and TSB. It does also have powerful reasoning capabilities so can be used to help with jobs that you might ask another AI chatbot. I would recommend talking to it like a colleague rather than a search engine to get the best results. Try to be specific with your questions to get the best answers.
  </p>

  <h3>How to use</h3>
  <p>
    To use the smart assistant simply type your question into the input box and hit the "Send" button. The AI will then process your question and provide an answer. You can have a back-and-forth conversation with the AI by asking follow-up questions. Each conversation is stored in the chat history on the right side of the screen. <strong>Note:</strong> Each conversation is unique and the AI will not remember previous conversations.
  </p>
  <h3>Editing, Undoing</h3>
  <p>
    If you asked it a question and are not happy with the answer you can either:
    <ul>
      <li>Click the "Undo" button (Small circle button on the bottom left of last AI response) to edit the previous sent question and refine it to be more specific.</li>
      <li>Click the "Edit" button (Small pencil icon on the bottom right of your messages) to modify a previous message. You need to press the tick after editing to save the changes. This will forget the part of the conversation after that message and regenerate a new response.</li>
      <li>Send a follow up message to clarify what you wanted it to do.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>Managing conversations</h3>
  <p>
    You can manage your conversations using the buttons above the chat box, or in the side bar on the left:
    <br>
    <em>Note that all conversations are autosaved by default.</em>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>New Conversation</strong> - Starts a new conversation and clears the chat history.</li>
      <li><strong>Delete Conversation</strong> - Deletes the current conversation from history.</li>
      <li><strong>Load Conversation</strong> - Loads a previously saved conversation from history.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section-box">
  <h2 id="underlying-db">Underlying database</h2>
  <p>
    Key to the smart tools platform is a database that is generated by scarping the public websites of TAIC, ATSB and TSB and processing the PDF reports. This database is then used to power both the smart search and smart assistant features.
  </p>

  <h3>Document types</h3>
  In the database there are 4 types of the documents:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>section</strong> - Each report is divided into numbered sections (if possible), otherwise simply split it paragraph sized chunks of text</li>
    <li><strong>summary</strong> - For ATSB and TAIC there are investigation summaries present on the public webpage. These are normally similar too but not always identical to the executive summaries.</li>
    <li><strong>safety issue</strong> - For ATSB the safety issues are scrapped directly from website. For TSB and TAIC they are extracted from the report so are not guaranteed to be identical, in cases where reports don't have safety issues and the AI deems a safety issues was present according to current defintion it will infer the safety issue</li>
    <li><strong>recommendation</strong> - All recommendations are either extracted verbatium from the reports or scraped from webpages.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Year</h3>
  <p>
    The year of the documents are related to the occurrence date of the accidents.
  </p>

  <h3>IDs</h3>
  <p>
    Each document in the database has a unique ID that is associated with it. It is called the "document_id". A document will be one of the four types listed above (section, summary, safety issue, recommendation). Furthermore each document is associated with a single investigation report which also has its own unique ID called the "report_id", which also is linked to the "agency_id" that is the ID the agency uses to identify the report.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section-box">
  <h2 id="smart-search">Smart Search</h2>
  <p>
    This is a semantic search engine of the database. You conduct searches in the same way as a normal search engine. Type your query in the search box and press enter. You can use the filters to narrow down the results.
    <br>
    <strong>Note: seraching if you see nothing happen make sure to scroll to the bottom of the page to see the progress bar as it can take a few seconds to search.</strong>
  </p>

  <h3>Relevance filters</h3>
  <p>
    When doing a semantic serach the results are ranked by relevance to the query. With 1 being the most relevant and 0 being the least relevant. It is default set to 0.2 to filter out all of the irrelevant results. You can adjust this to your liking if you are not getting enough results or want to see more results. It can be really sensitive to small changes so try adjusting it in increments of 0.05.
  </p>

  <h3>Graphs</h3>
  <p>
    The search results page also includes graphs to help visualise the results. You can see the distribution of document types and years in the results. This can help you identify trends and patterns in the data. Click on the 'Results graph' drop down just above the results to view these visualizations. Each of them can be downloaded as an image by clicking the camera icon in the top right of the graph.
  </p>

  <h3>Post search searching</h3>
  <p>
    After performing a search, you can further refine your results using the post-search searching. In the search bar at the top right of the results table you can type in words and it will do an exact word match filter on the results already returned from the semantic search. This is useful for narrowing down results to specific topics or keywords after the initial semantic search has been performed.
  </p>

  <h3>Regular text search</h3>
  <p>
    You can also do a regular text search by enclosing your search terms in double quotes. For example: "fuel starvation". This will return all results that contain the text "fuel starvation" regardless of the semantic meaning.
