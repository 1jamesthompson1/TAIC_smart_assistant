Below you'll find concise, FAQ-style documentation for the smart tools platform. If you have any further questions, please reach out to the maintainer — their details are in the footer of the application.

  <h2 id="underlying-db">Underlying database</h2>
  <p>
  The smart tools platform depends on a database generated by scraping the public websites of TAIC, ATSB, and TSB and processing PDF reports. This database powers both the smart search and smart assistant features.
  </p>

  <h3>Document types</h3>
  In the database there are four types of 'documents' that you or the Smart Assistant can search on:
  <ul>
  <li><strong>section</strong> - Each report is divided into numbered sections where possible; otherwise it is split into paragraph-sized chunks of text.</li>
  <li><strong>summary</strong> - For ATSB and TAIC there are investigation summaries on the public webpages. These are normally similar to, but not always identical to, the executive summaries. <em>Warning: TSB has no summaries in the dataset</em></li>
  <li><strong>safety issue</strong> - For ATSB, safety issues are scraped directly from the website. For TSB and TAIC they are extracted from the report and may not be identical. In cases where reports don't list safety issues and the AI engine determines a safety issue is present (according to the current TAIC definition), it will infer one.</li>
  <li><strong>recommendation</strong> - All recommendations are either extracted verbatim from the reports or scraped from webpages.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Year</h3>
  <p>
  The year of a document is based on the occurrence date of the accident.
  </p>

  <h3>IDs</h3>
  <p>
  Each document in the database has a unique ID called the "document_id". A document will be one of the four types listed above (section, summary, safety issue, recommendation). Each document is also associated with a single investigation report that has its own unique ID called the "report_id", which is linked to the "agency_id" used by the agency to identify the report.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section-box">
  <h2 id="smart-assistant">Smart Assistant</h2>
  <p>
  This is a smart assistant powered by a Large Language Model (a similar model to ChatGPT). The Smart Assistant has access to a database of documents it uses to answer your questions. You can ask it about investigation reports from TAIC, ATSB, and TSB. It also has powerful reasoning capabilities and can help with tasks you might ask another AI chatbot to perform.

  For the best results, talk to the Smart Assistant like a colleague rather than a search engine. Be specific with your questions to get the best answers.
  </p>

  <h3>How to use</h3>
  <p>
    To use the Smart Assistant, type your question into the input box and hit the "Send" button. The Smart Assistant will then process your question and provide an answer. You can have a back-and-forth conversation with the Smart Assistant by asking follow-up questions. Each conversation is stored in the chat history on the right side of the screen. <strong>Note: Each conversation is separate. The Smart Assistant cannot reference information from an earlier conversation.</strong>
  </p>
  <h3>Editing, Undoing</h3>
  <p>
  If you ask the Smart Assistant a question and are not happy with the answer, you can either:
    <ul>
      <li>Click the "Undo" button (the small circle button on the bottom left of last Smart Assistant response) to edit the previously sent question and refine it to be more specific.</li>
  <li>Click the "Edit" button (small pencil icon on the bottom right of your sent message) to modify a previous message. You must press the checkmark after editing to save the changes. This will remove the response to the original message and generate a new response based on the edited message.</li>
      <li>Ask a follow-up question to clarify what you wanted it to do.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>Managing conversations</h3>
  <p>
    You can manage your conversations using the buttons above the chat box, or in the side bar on the left:
    <br>
  <em>Note that all conversations are auto-saved by default.</em>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>New Conversation</strong> - Starts a new conversation and clears the chat history.</li>
      <li><strong>Delete Conversation</strong> - Deletes the current conversation from history.</li>
      <li><strong>Load Conversation</strong> - Loads a previously saved conversation from history.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

<div class="section-box">
  <h2 id="smart-search">Smart Search</h2>
  <p>
    This is a smart search interface to the underlying database, it will search based on the meaning of your query rather than exact keywords. You can conduct searches in the same way as a normal search engine such as Google. Type your query in the search box, press enter, and it will return the results in the table below. You can use the filters to narrow down the results.
    <br>
  <strong>Note: If nothing happens when you search, scroll to the bottom of the page to see the progress bar — it may take a few seconds to run.</strong>
  </p>

  <h3>Relevance filters</h3>
  <p>
  When performing a smart search, results are ranked by relevance (1 is most relevant, 0 is least relevant). The default relevance filter is 0.2 to filter out irrelevant results. You can adjust this to your liking if you're not getting enough results or want more. The filter can be sensitive, so try adjusting in increments of 0.05.
  </p>

  <h3>Graphs</h3>
  <p>
    The search results page also includes graphs to help show the results. You can see the distribution of document types and years in the results. This can help you identify trends and patterns in the data. Click on the 'Results graph' drop down just above the results to view these graphs. Each of them can be downloaded by clicking the camera icon in the top right of the graph.
  </p>

  <h3>Post-search filtering</h3>
  <p>
  After performing a search, you can further refine your results using post-search filtering. In the search bar at the top right of the results table, type words to perform an exact text filter on the results already returned by the smart search. This is useful for narrowing down results to specific topics or keywords.
  </p>

  <h3>Regular text search</h3>
  <p>
    You can also do a regular text search by enclosing your search terms in double quotes. For example: "fuel starvation". This will return all results that contain the text "fuel starvation" regardless of the meaning.
