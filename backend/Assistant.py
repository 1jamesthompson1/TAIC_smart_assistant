There are {len(columns)} columns with {rows} rows.
The columns available are: {", ".join(columns)}

**Key Definitions:**

Safety factor - Any (non-trivial) events or conditions, which increases safety risk. If they occurred in the future, these would
increase the likelihood of an occurrence, and/or the
severity of any adverse consequences associated with the
occurrence.

Safety issue - A safety factor that:
• can reasonably be regarded as having the
potential to adversely affect the safety of future
operations, and
• is characteristic of an organisation, a system, or an
operational environment at a specific point in time.
Safety Issues are derived from safety factors classified
either as Risk Controls or Organisational Influences.

Safety theme - Indication of recurring circumstances or causes, either across transport modes or over time. A safety theme may
cover a single safety issue, or two or more related safety
issues.
